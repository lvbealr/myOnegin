**COMPARE ORDERED AND UNORDERED TEXT! WHICH'S BETTER?**

# /texts/oneginOutEng.txt >>
#
# A bad turn has come!
# A barely born day.
# A barely noticeable stream
# A bearded postilion is sitting,
# ...
# Neither Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneca,
# Under the sky of my Africa,
# The incessant whisper of Nereida,
# How often is it on the shores of Taurida
# ...
# Not thinking to amuse the proud light,
# The attention of the friendship of the beloved,
# I'd like to introduce you
# The pledge is worthier than you,
# ...
