A bad turn has come!
A barely born day.
A barely noticeable stream
A bearded postilion is sitting,
A big, disheveled bear;
A block of snow is falling.
A bottle of light wine,
A cab pulls to the stock exchange,
A caravan of noisy geese
A caricature of southern winters,
A cart in front of the house at the gate
A cherished song,
A cold, stern conversation,
A cosmopolitan, a patriot,
A current splashed from the comet;
A dashing caravan is flying;
A deep, eternal chorus of shafts,
A different, old spring
A diligent ear readily tends to
A disappointed lorgnette,
A disease that causes
A dream that is sad, then charming
A fan of fame and freedom,
A fan of peaceful aonides,
A fat Trifle has arrived;
A fickle admirer
A flicker, a whirlwind of fast vapors,
A flirt, a flighty child!
A fortune teller, an interpreter of dreams.
A French servant,
A friend of my youth,
A funny joke, a lie.
A gambler and a sergeant of the guards.
A general alarm will be raised.
A girl at the age of thirteen!
A glass, an offering to a neighbor,
A glass full of wine,
A glass of red wine;
A glutton, a bribe taker and a buffoon.
A happy deadline was set.
A heavy gossip, an old rascal,
A high step was waiting.
A holy mystery, and for us
A huge, neglected garden,
A humble girl's love?
A hymn of praise to the father of the worlds.
A jug of cranberry water.
A languid mind will not smile,
A learned fellow, but a pedant:
A letter for a sweet hero
A light steam was billowing under it.
A little bit of baby clothes,
A little boy, captured by Olga,
A little nonsense in front of the hostess
A long silence passes,
A luxurious touch.
A magical land! There in the old years,
A magnificent house is shining;
A meadow is turned into a swamp
A meal, thoughts and deeds
A merry birthday party.
A miserable life of tinsel,
A momentary thought, a long trail,
A monotonous family,
A moral novel,
A Muscovite in a Harold's Raincoat,
A new face is calling us.
A newborn creation,
A noisy swarm is flying to the field.
A novel in the taste of La Fontaine
A peaceful dream. Onegin is mine
A philosopher at the age of eighteen.
A picture of happy love.
A pleading look, a mute reproach,
A pleasant lot commanded;
A pleasantly cheeky epigram
A poem of songs at twenty-five.
A poet, a thoughtful dreamer,
A poet in the heat of his judgments
A prolonged howl is heard,
(A punishment based on,
A rattling, continuous ringing
A reasonable sense without vulgar topics,
A rebellious imagination,
A reliable friend, a peaceful landowner
A report from the steward,
A riding crop. Tanya dahle;
A rustic evening will come:
A sad and dangerous eccentric,
A sad heart does not sleep in him:
A saint of fulfilled dreams,
A secluded study,
A semi- painful joy:
A series of tedious paintings,
A sharp nail mark;
A short call, or a cartel:
A silent monument of dreaming,
A simpering cat sitting on the stove,
A simple inscription and a tear
A simple monument has been erected.
A simple, Russian family,
A soulful flight?
A splinter crackles in front of her.
A story full of feelings,
A stranger to everyone, not bound by anything,
A stray neighbor came to me,
A stream that is not constrained in winter;
A substitute for happiness. Oh my God!
A sweet conversation of friends.
A sweet little cat to the heart of virgins.
A tombstone, the temple of Cypress,
A treasured treasure of tears and happiness,
A trembling, disastrous bridge,
A trumpet, a disguise and a dagger,
A useful trade having chosen,
(A very painful property)
A village, a grove under the hill
(A voluntary cross).
A warm friend, a welcome friend,
A weirdo, having got to a huge feast,
A wet shoe will get stuck;
A whisper ran through the hall
A wit, recently from Tambov,
A wolf comes out on the road;
A wreath was worthy of kindness.
A young and fresh kiss,
A young heart. But now
A young lover again
A young soul, a greedy sorrow;
About a wonderful night, about the moon
About an early meeting; and Tatiana
About Christmas to visit them
About different dishes and traffic jams,
About evil spirits and about girls;
About haymaking, about wine,
About her, adjusting your wig,
About Lensky's wedding a long time ago
About Olga, he writes about
About Olga: such is love!
About public affairs;
About the boredom of a single life;
About the kennel, about his family,
About the legs of ladies I know.
About the news of the city, about fashion
About the rain, about flax, about the barnyard
About your old years:
Above her and in the midst of rebellious storms
Above the misty river;
Above the nameless river
Above their eyebrows is the inscription of hell:
Above this humble urn
Accept my confession:
Accept the collection of motley chapters,
Accessible to feeling alone;
According to all the traditions of antiquity
According to the stories of young moustaches,
Accustomed to her room.
Acutely or not, I could have lied.
Admiring the noisy crowding,
Adriatic waves,
Affectation, nothing more.
Afraid of expensive runs,
Afraid of false shame.
Afraid of jealous judgments,
After all, Olenka is younger than her.
After reading the sad message,
After that, the muse revived them:
Ah, brothers! How pleased I was,
Ah, he loved, as in our summers
Ah! I couldn't forget for a long time
Ah, maybe her love
Alas! a friend of so many years,
Alas, a well-deserved reproach!
Alas, for various amusements
Alas, it is not difficult to guess!
Alas! Now it's days and nights,
Alas! on the reins of life
Alas, Tatiana is fading,
Alas! the bride is young
Alas, the lover is young,
Albeit a small work. I knew with you
Alien to her: scary stories
All ages are submissive to love;
All good things: vigils and sleep
All her little friends,
All objects are mysterious to her
All prejudices have been eliminated,
All sons of greedy boredom.
All that is enviable for a poet:
All the best as a pledge,
All the daughters were expecting their own
All the feelings in Lensky were confused,
All the lots were equal
All the same: I haven't changed them
All the same to hear objections,
All the senses are suddenly struck.
All these words are not in Russian;
All this glitter, and noise, and smoke
All this is low nature;
All this is now dilapidated,
All this often gives
All this rags of the masquerade,
All this without asking my husband.
Allow me: maybe you want to
Allow me, my reader,
Almost at that time I did not comprehend
Almost at the age of eighteen.
Alone among his possessions,
Alone, immersed in calculations,
Alone, sad under the window
Alone, under the Finnish sky,
Alone with your soul
Along the free crossroads of the sea
Along the sleepy street in rows
Along the St. Petersburg pavement,
Already awakened by the drum.
Although he has other things
Although he is an unknown person,
Although he knew people, of course
Although he looked at it, he couldn't be more diligent,
Although I could find a grain.
Although I didn't understand a lot of them,
Although it's late, there is an introduction.
Although people are unwilling
Although sometimes I'm in a mess myself
Although there are no streets or palaces,
Although this book was not
Although we don't want to admit it.
Although we know that Eugene
Always an enthusiastic hero
Always an enthusiastic speech
Always as cheerful as the morning,
Always, everywhere there is one dream,
Always frowning, silent,
Always happy with himself,
Always humble, always obedient,
Always in fashion and to the face;
Always like this: frowning brow,
Always lofty feelings,
Always unjustly persecuted,
Am I going to be thirty soon?
Amber on the tubes of Tsargrad,
Amid worries and in silence,
Among the brilliant victories,
Among the fans of the obedient
Among the fashionable and ancient halls.
Among the fields, around the hills;
An abandoned cart is forgotten.
An admirer of Kant and a poet.
An angry gentleman for everything:
An ardent and rather strange spirit,
An eloquent madcap.
An hour or two passes, and now
An immodest look, or an answer,
An impatient hero.
An important general is behind her.
An indifferent spectator of fun,
An insignificant ghost, or else
An invaluable reward,
An office enters the silent one
An old man with a lot to do,
An old memory
An old woman in a long padded jacket;
An old woman saying goodbye to her daughter,
An unfamiliar yard is in front of her,
And a belated warehouse of speeches;
And a bright day will begin to play;
And a column with a cast-iron doll
And a friendly glass of wine
And a garden over a bright river.
And a golden pineapple.
And a hot lonely dream,
And a long sitting.
And a lot of his quirks.
And a maiden
And a migratory snowstorm
And a paw with sharp claws
And a pile of books, and under the window
And a powerful life gives
And a retired adviser to Flyanov,
And a ring came out for her
And a share in idle silence,
And a sharp, chilled mind.
And a swarm of young traitors,
And a table with a dimmed lamp,
And a virtuous mother.
And a wayward head,
And a wreath of sweet love
And a young pilgrim
And about her among themselves
And about Onegin the distant
And, according to the custom of the people,
And after that, at home all day,
And again, devoted to idleness,
And again thoughtful, sad
And age-old prejudices,
And aim at the thigh or the temple.
And all that kind of rabble
And all the neighbors were entertained.
And all the shades of winter bliss;
And an attractive face.
And an eternally inspired gaze,
And an inattentive lorgnette.
And an incredulous old man,
And an obtrusive lorgnette
And another world opened up to her.
And arguments, and funny dreams!
And, as if burned by fire,
And at the end of the last part
And at the noon hour in a circle
And at thirty he is advantageously married;
And at this very moment
And babysitter the girl with a plea
And before the roaring abyss,
And belated outfits,
And belated reviews,
And, bending down, he whispers softly to her
And beyond the grave
And boldly instead of bee Nna
And brushes of thirty kinds
And by the way, I'll note in parentheses,
And by the way: Larina is simple,
And certainly a lot of revenge.
And, come on, friend; does it really matter?
And, come on, Tanya! These summers
And common sense about this and that.
And crowns were predicted for the children
And, curious, now
And curses their leisure time,
And day and night until we meet again.
And dinner. We know the time
And does he believe in his chosen dream?
And dreams, and card fortune-telling,
And drops of tears, and on the bench
And Dunya pours tea;
And each one whispered to her:
And earn me a tribute of glory:
And enjoying without loving.
And equally strict analysis
And even an honest man:
And even funny nonsense
And even though he was an ardent rake,
And even with a trembling hand
And everyone is shouting: mine! Mine!
And everyone poured out into the hall.
And everyone took their own gun.
And everything is on Eugene's mind,
And everything, saying goodbye, was bustling
And everything seems dark to her?
And everything seems priceless to her,
And everything that pleases, lives,
And everything was dozing in silence
And exclamations, and bread and salt.
And falls. Misty eyes
And far from my law.
And fascinating and harmful?
And finally before dawn,
And finally for Tatiana
And finally I got behind them;
And finally I saw the light.
And finally in my bed
And finally petrify
And finally she quietly says:
And finally squandered.
And finally they opened
And finally updated
And, Fleur turned away from the hat,
And flocks of jackdaws on crosses.
And Flyanov, not quite healthy,
And following the orderly crowd
And for a long time, as if through a fog,
And for a long time my heart was sad.
And for sure: by the power of magnetism
And for the delivery of the letter.
And for the journalists to eat
And, friends, no one, by God!
And, full of inspiration again,
And full of sincere sadness,
And futile teases the appetite,
And generally despised them,
And glitter and noisy feasts,
And glory! But it promises losses
And glory is a sweet torment
And gradually put to sleep
And grandfather's faithful capital
And, handing me the faithful staff,
And happiness was so possible,
And harmonic ideas
And, having forgotten the capital of the far
And he also eats and drinks for two.
And he answers: Agathon.
And he ate and drank in his dressing gown;
And he beats the leg with a quick foot.
And he began to wander without a purpose,
And he bowed casually;
And he bows his head
And he calmed the agony of his heart,
And he came out of the bathroom
And he could have been in the company of a prince
And he couldn't. She asked if he had been here long, where he came from
And he dedicated a sigh to the ashes;
And he did not get into the perky workshop
And he didn't become a poet.,
And he didn't scare anyone's ears.
And he does not listen to friendly splashes,
And he doesn't know himself in the morning,
And he doesn't press the letter
And he doesn't say anything.
And he doesn't share it with anyone.
And he enters the deserted courtyard.
And he expressed himself with difficulty
And he finds no relief
And he forbade forgetting!
And he gave the land as collateral.
And he goes straight into the hall
And he hung his nose in silence.
And he is stubborn, he does not want to fall behind,
And he jumps. A couple of pistols,
And he left them without regret,
And he looks at Onegin
And he looks furtively at the door.
And he looks into the dark field.
And he moves our hearts.
And he passes the verse to her.
And he played only chords on them,
And he puts it on the doorstep.
And he remained motionless.
And he remembered Tatiana Mila
And he respected that feeling too.
And he said:
And he said: You wrote to me,
And he says: that was a poet!
And he shakes his hand and burns
And he sleeps with her constantly.
And he speaks quietly to the nanny:
And he suspected miracles.
And he thinks: Has something happened to Olga?
And he took a new crown.
And he took me for a walk in the Summer Garden.
And he waits: will it come? But he doesn't hear it.
And he wakes up Lensky with an appeal:
And he walks in an open field,
And he wanders wildly with his eyes,
And he was getting dressed
And he was purring: You're right.
And he weaves poor shoes.
And he went light
And he will lead a baptized world
And he will touch someone's heart.;
And he worried her heart!
And he's ashamed to recognize himself;
And he's calling her to the cotillion.
And he's insensitive to her
And he's still a good member of the club,
And hears a voice: well? dead.
And her heart was far away
And her voice sounds
And, herald of the morning, the wind blows,
And here, I'm completely tired,
And here in the hut between the servants
And here is my hero,
And here is one, one Tatiana!
And here is the public opinion!
And here she is in my garden
And his bones are at peace
And his mother threatens him through the window
And his song was clear,
And hopeless selfishness.
And how many jokes and poems,
And how the bacchante frolicked,
And, I admit, I ran away from them,
And I am a prudent Bordeaux
And I am deprived of that: for you
And I am very glad that the old way
And I boldly entrust myself to her
And I can say that I got into a battle
And I can't read enough.
And I couldn't think of a better one.
And I didn't care about that,
And I ended up with the neighbors.
And I fed it with gingerbread!
And I feel the leg in my hands;
And I forgot the speech of the gods
And I have to die in silence.
And I haven't read Cicero,
And I hear your angry reproach.
And I, imputing to myself the law
And I loved you; so what?
And I managed to occupy her soul.
And I, perhaps, am the tomb
And I read a book in the morning
And I read it to myself.
And I see that I am blaming myself before you,
And I surrender to my fate.
And, I think, I read with horror
And I thought: it's stupid to bother me
And I took it in my arms like that!
And I waited
And I was attracted to thinking:
And I was proud among friends
And I was so hard on the ears!
And I was thirteen years old.
And I was yawning in advance,
And I would be as happy as I could!
And I would be glad to say goodbye to him.
And I'll give you a thoughtful outfit.;
And I'm following her lazily.
And I'm not attached to her much.;
And I'm thinking about Svetlana
And I'm wasting my time in vain
And importantly repeats to her
And in a silent office,
And in a thoughtless letter
And in a voice, everything was decided like this,
And in front of him is imagination
And in my mind I said: Here he is!
And in the cruel solitude
And in the midst of the midday swells,
And in the noise of the light and in the silence
And in the silent office
And in their mouths the language is foreign
And interrupted him in the meantime
And into a sweet, sinless sleep
And into the twilight of the lime alleys,
And is there really no return for her?
And isn't it one of their sides?
And it beats with a rainbow wing,
And it cracks and flaps its wings;
And it crumbled, then
And it is certainly committed
And, it is deeply immersed in,
And it is destined to be completely different
And it is unlikely to be in his honor.
And it serves you right: in a strict analysis,
And it starts a little bit
And it would be possible to be noble Here
And it's all the same croaking,
And it's nice to fool a smart one,
And it's time to come without me;
And jokingly, with bile in half,
And know and fashion patterns,
And labor, and flour, and joy,
And ladies and fashionable weirdos.
And laugh about something.
And lean on the granite,
And leaning against the door,
And Lensky pawns the rook
And Lensky, squinting his left eye,
And lighter than a swallow, it flies in;
And lit up with a languid light
And locked it in a dark corner.
And long live to this day
And loose hair,
And Lord Byron's portrait,
And make the ladies smile
And maybe even more gently.
And maybe for many days.
And meanwhile the moon was shining
And met by Vesper the rooster;
And miles, to amuse the idle gaze,
And more trembling than a hunted deer,
And my Eugene has left you.
And my heart breaks in half.
And, near him, she was noticed,
And, no one, I'm sure!
And now all minds are in a fog,
And now everything is dark for me, Tanya:
And now from a nearby village
And now he has become her idol
And now I am a muse for the first time
And now the blood is getting cold,
And now the frosts are already cracking
And now the neighbor is grandiose
And now! What's at my feet
And now with him before the altar
And often alone all day
And Olga is all wrapped up in sleep.
And on the Baltic waves
And on the floor is Monsieur Triquet,
And on the grave in the moonlight,
And on the last one you will read:
And Onegin is with her in a vague dream
And Onegin is with him.
And Onegin went out;
And onto the porch.
And other things. Her doubts
And our grandchildren in a good hour
And our rhyming brothers
And our virgin enjoyed it
And, pampered feelings are a joy,
And, panting, onto the bench
And, Phoebe's defying threats,
And plunge the reapers into the waves
And pour out sharp words,
And pride and direct honor.
And proud ladies she glides;
And put them on the barrier,
And quietly aim at the pale forehead
And quietly tears are pouring down like a river,
And quietly the edge of the earth brightens,
And rainbows bring snow;
And Richardson and Rousseau.
And right away, blessed is the humble lover
And romantic roses;
And Russian is like French
And sat at the table.
And, saved by fate,
And scolds uninvited guests;
And secondly: let the poet
And seductive nights.
And she cried for a long time.
And she goes into the garden to be sad,
And she got up from her bench;
And she hands him the laundry.
And she has no strength to run anymore.
And she is afraid; and hurriedly
And she is too lazy to step further.
And She ran after me into the distance.
And she spoke in a singsong voice,
And she was running after him,
And she went wild between them,
And she will squeak (my God!):
And she's really terrified.:
And silent, like Svetlana,
And silently exchanged glances
And so: for related dinners
And so Tatiana comes down the hill,
And so they both aged.
And so they introduced a stranger into the family
And, sobbing, at your feet
And softly carpeted mountains
And something, and a vague distance,
And something pale and thin,
And soon Olya's ringing voice
And soon, soon the storms will follow
And soon they became inseparable.
And St. Petersburg is restless
And, staring at an alien light
And stately wigs.
And still: hope for them
And stoves in colorful tiles.
And strange behavior with Olga
And Strasbourg is an imperishable pie
And stretch the man
And suddenly a leap, and suddenly it flies,
And suddenly he knew how to part with it,
And suddenly her eyes are motionless,
And swearing, and a saber, and lead.
And sweet Tanya's youth pales:
And take a walk and relax:
And Tanya enters the house empty,
And Tanya hears this news.
And Tanya, hiding her excitement,
And Tanya is not so terrible,
And Tanya was elbowed at once,
And Tanya woke up in horror
And Tatiana has a wonderful dream.
And Tatiana's husband showed up,
And teaches the alphabet to children.
And tears and rhymes et cetera?..
And tears, secret torments are a joy
And that mediocrity is the only one
And that one, but we'll tell you everything after,
And that their hand will not waver
(And that's how I started my novel);
And that's right, you would agree,
And that's what the world is spinning on!
And that's what you expect to fall.
And the anger of dark epigrams.
And the ball shines in all its glory.
And the beauty of important simplicity.
And the boredom of festive undertakings.
And the boy served cream;
And the bread maker, the German is neat,
And the calendar of the eighth year:
And the canopy expanded thick
And the captives of the shores of Salgir.
And the circle of despicable comrades,
And the coachman, around the lights,
And the coffin secrets are fatal,
And the cold of calm pride,
And the color is pale and the appearance is dull;
And the condescending Eugene,
And the cuckold is majestic,
And the curls are shoulder-length black.
And the curtain parted the floors;
And the curtain rises And makes a noise.
And the cute floor is light as a feather.
And the dark frame of men
And the dark mind cleared up.
And the day gradually rises.
And the distance of a free novel
And the door opened in front of them,
And the dreams of a thoughtful soul.
And the early ringing of the bells,
And the endless cotillion
And the enterprising Prince;
And the epigram moves
And the exclamations poured out.
And the fear of vice and shame,
And the feelings and thoughts of the young,
And the fever does not go away.,
And the first snow from the roof of the bathhouse
And the friendship of hard husbands!
And the gaze of a caring servant.
And the glory of our antiquity,
And the grandmothers repeat in chorus:
And the great-grandfathers are crowding towards the coffin.
And the guests are coming from the courtyard.
And the haze of Epiphany evenings.
And the heart makes us tremble
And the hearts are trembling dreams.
And the hearts of the sorrowful will be noticed.
And the horses are fighting, white foam
And the incomparable Grandison,
And the key dialect is heard,
And the land of the fathers, and imprisonment?
And the languid gaze was full of tears.
And the light greeted her with a smile;
And the memory of the young poet
And the mind is still shaky in its judgments,
And the moats of the paternal land.
And the modern man
And the more likely we destroy it
And, the morning moon is paler
And the morning turns at midnight,
And the muses of sublime art,
And the night, and the stars, and the moon,
And the nightingale in the darkness of the trees
And the noise of their windy pleasures.
And the old gentleman lived here;
And the old ones are delirious with novelty.
And the old thing is outdated,
And the one with whom he is educated
And the precious set of elegies
And the predictions of the moon.
And the roar of the skripok drowned
And the same Pomeranian, and the same husband;
And the secret of his heart,
And the secret of the marriage bed,
And the secular rabble encouraged,
And the shelf, with their dusty family,
And the signature: T. A. Annette;
And the slave blessed fate.
And the sleigh, and the dawn is late
And the sounds of gentle speeches,
And the thirst for knowledge and work,
And the thought of her inspired
And the thought sank into my heart;
And the tightness, and the brilliance, and the joy,
And the townswoman is young,
And the traveler is a stray,
And the trigger clicked for the first time.
And the truth is that in our summers
And the view out the window through the moonlight twilight,
And the virgin of the mountains, my ideal,
And the water is funny glass
And the whole gang suddenly disappeared;
And the window is shining brightly,
And the world is closed to him and mute?..
And the world will bestow bliss.
And the world's new brilliance and noise
And the youth of bygone days
And then, bored with pleasure,
And then everything started to get better.
And then he was silent the whole way.
And then secretly dishonor
And then she's alone
And then they separated importantly,
And then what happens with an evil smile
And there he triumphs.
And there he walks in the open,
And there is also a sad inscription
And there is no case (their gender is like that);
And there is noise in the hearing, and a sparkle in the eyes
And there is shouting and noise in the hut;
And there was a deep economy,
And there was a fireplace burning in front of him,
And there were childish pranks
And these letters and tears.
And they are silvered in the middle of the fields
And they are so painful.
And they become funny to us
And they chant
And they expose the forest around.
And they flew like an arrow.
And they have guests at the table
And they sang in chorus according to the order
And they were busy singing:
And they were promised every year
And they will only infuriate him.
And they're bringing tea. I love the hour
And think about the beauty of nails:
And thirst for fame and praise,
And this fifth notebook
And this mixture of ranks and years.
And this pale half-light,
And this sermon But you
And thoughts are dead capital
And to dispel her grief,
And to harass, and to curse,
And to me, Onegin, this splendor,
And to remember the past?
And to them in crazy feasts
And to think: he loved me,
And together for a few minutes
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
And travel to him,
And trembling and anger takes me away,
And truffles, the luxury of youth,
And unbridled passions.
And under the down pillow
And units of themselves.
And we don't shine with anything,
And we got it from him.
And we were captivated in the distance
And we will direct our way to the side,
And Werther, the rebellious martyr,
And what about it? His eyes read,
And what about it? Intoxicated with love,
And what about it? it is pleasant, sonorous;
And what about Onegin? By the way, brothers!
And what did I find with amazement?
And what does he live by, and why
And what does he see?.. at the table
And what? Just like that. I'm putting you to sleep
And what we called a frant.
And what will I call the hero;
And whatever confused her soul,
And when he went down to the coffin, he blessed him.
And where are the madrigals
And where, God knows. The trace was gone.
And where his ashes lie,
And where is her sister now?
And where is the fugitive of people and light,
And where the conversation is about her.
And whist, hitherto famous,
And who came out from under it?
And why, I don't see.)
And with a fiery and tender heart?
And with a gullible dazzle
And, with tender eyes
And with timid steps
And without taking my eyes off him,
And without that, heaven is not heaven for you.
And words of amiable negligence?
And write them madrigals!
And yet her soul ached,
And you, a living and constant,
And you, cherished dreams,
And you, familiar forests;
And you, familiar mountain peaks,
And you, my faithful ideal,
And you sensitive ladies,
And you, the benevolent reader,
And you, the younger inspiration,
And you, young beauties,
And you'll have a nice winter.
And young fever and young delirium.
Angry and coldly jealous!
Animated creatures,
Anisya came to her at once,
Annoyance? vanity? or again
Another poet with a luxurious style
Appeared to me for the first time
Appeared to the eyes of the hellish ghosts;
Appliances, chairs as soon as possible;
Appointed by a strict fate?
Approaching the moment of vengeance,
Archived young men in a crowd
Are my golden days of spring?
Are there any rebellious memories,
Are we up to the task and not strange?
Are you following me?
Are you frivolous of passions?
Are you still the same? Are the other virgins,
Armed with a blunt cue,
Arming both speech and gaze,
Around the carriage of the young,
Around the ladies as near the paintings.
Arrive tomorrow before dawn,
As a friend of my sad days,
As a model of perfection.
As a sign of friendship, the faithful have been introduced,
As a tribute to the finished land.
As an oppressive dignity
As deceptive as their legs.
As I am with my Onegin.
As I said, my Zaretsky,
As I wished then with the waves
As if hearing an angry rebuke.
As if it's impossible for us
As if thunderstruck.
As in the meadows, your light footprint.
As it was in the old days
As Sadi once said.
As soon as I remember the look is cold
As soon as it's about yourself.
(As they say, mechanically)
As we see from afar,
(As you are, of course, familiar with it),
Aspens, birches and lime trees naked
Aspires to a field life,
At a noble distance;
At first, everyone went to see him;
At first I wanted to be silent;
At first Madame followed him,
At first she had no time for them,
At first they look around in silence
At his coffin board,
At Kharitonya's in the alley
At least casually, at least at random;
At least I'll go back to him, of course,
At least it's not much use at all
At least, maybe another lady
At least my advice
At least rarely, at least once a week
At least respect for the years
At least she was dazzling.
At least the sound of the speeches
At least there is no romanticism here
At least with regret,
At Pelageya Nikolaevna's
At that time, the pie was fat
At the aunt of Princess Elena
At the beginning of my novel
At the beginning of our novel,
At the cost of his funny words,
At the cry of her frightened
At the dawn of the shepherd
At the end of the letter, put ae,
At the feet of a beautiful mistress
At the snow and at his wife.
At the turn of our years,
At these words, he drained
Attentive or indifferent!
Attract mocking glances!..
Attracts conditional beauty
Au is like a lover
Aurors of the northern Alay
Automedons are our strikers,
Awakened at the usual hour
Away from the fuss of rumor,
Awkward, he's barely
B died in the midst of children,
Bad magazine going over,
Balconies, lions on the gates
Barely breathing,
Barely breathing; she circles around
Barely remembering their love and anger.
Barking, laughing, singing, whistling and clapping,
Be brave, healthy, sick,
Beauties light headdresses,
Because he couldn't always
Because he was yawning anyway
Because I belong to them.
Beckoning to the sails of ships.
Beds are made; for guests
Beef steaks and Strasbourg pie
Before her is a motley regiment of liveries,
Before my dear Olga,
Before Onegin gathered
Before the slow fire
Before the young heroine,
Before this clarity of view,
Before this frisky soul!..
Before this gentle simplicity,
Before which life is far away
Before you with death on your forehead,
Beg and demand recognition,
Behind him is a line of narrow, long glasses,
Being a petty slave's feelings?
Being offended by such an act,
Believe me (conscience is a guarantee),
Believe me: my shame
Besides, the opinions of the spouse
Besides, they are so immaculate,
Besides, this is the case
Between Onegin and me,
Between reasonable people
Between roast and blanc manger,
Between the Limburg cheese alive
Between the mountains lying in a semicircle,
Between the old songs of the almanac
Between two aunts at the column,
Billiards is abandoned, the cue is forgotten,
Bless my long work,
Blessed is he a hundred times who is devoted to the faith,
Blessed is he who celebrates life early
Blessed is he who has combined with her
Blessed is He who has known their agitation
Blessed is he who matured in time,
Blessed is he who was young when he was young,
Blessed is the coming of darkness!
Blessed is the day of worries,
Blessed is the one who did not know them,
Blessed though, maybe she is
Blessed wine
Blessing the ruts
Blind Fortune and people
Blood flowed steaming from the wound.
Bloomed like a hidden lily of the valley,
Blowing your nose, coughing, shushing, clapping;
Blushing like a palm cherub,
Boiling in empty action.
Boiling Lensky did not want to
Bored with their harness,
Boredom and longing
Boston and the Old Men's Pawnshop,
Both almanacs and magazines,
Both for nails and teeth.
Both in the afternoon and in the evening alone;
Both the lush color and the sweet fruit.
Both wayward and empty
Boulevards, towers, Cossacks,
Bowing his tired head,
Bowing their cheerful horns,
Bows, shuffling of guests,
Boys are a joyful people
Boys, shops, lanterns,
Breeds ducks and geese
Brega with a motionless river
Brilliant, semi-airy,
Brought by a wandering merchant
Bukharans, sleighs, vegetable gardens,
Bullets go into the faceted barrel,
Buried deep in the snow.
Burning with longing and longing,
But a horse with a blunted horseshoe
But a husband with honor and intelligence.
But a sinister dream promises her
But a very sweet old lady;
But a wildly secular feud
But after arriving at my uncle's village,
But after receiving Tanya's message,
But also a fiery youth
But, amused by an empty dream,
But an indifferent princess,
But an unapproachable goddess
But at a late age and infertile,
But brighter, brighter it just burns
But brighter than all the friends of heaven
But come on, come on; stop it:
But come on. I need to hurry up
But death from him is kind.
But distant hopes
But dolls even in these years
But enough is enough. It's time for me to get busy
But everyone in the living room is occupied
But finally she sighed
But first he asks for permission
But from a shaggy footman
But God save us from our friends!
But he didn't want to cheat
But he finally fell out of love
But he has completely cooled down to life.
But he sulked in his corner,
But he was wrong: Eugene
But he's certainly an honest guy.
But he's not going; he's ahead of time
But her husband loved her cordially,
But here we congratulate you on your victory
But hush! Do you hear? The critic is strict
But I am sorry for the old sadness.
But I am the fruit of my dreams
But I can't translate it;
But I didn't see any harm in books;
But I don't want to fix them.
But I don't want to praise you.;
But I fell behind their union
But I have no time for him now.
But I, loving, was stupid and dumb.
But I think I would like to
But I'll just tell you about it
But I'm given to someone else.;
But I'm not going to fight
But I'm not made for bliss.;
But I'm on bail, Your Honor.,
But I'm talking to our lady.
But I'm tired of Didlo too.
But I'm tired of him immensely.
But I've read Adam Smith.
But if morals didn't suffer,
But in general their conversation
But in the cities, in the villages
But in the midst of sad rocks,
But in the old days, Princess Alina,
But in the strict rules of art,
But it changes with a noisy foam
But it is enough to glorify the arrogant
But it's over. They're coming for dinner.
But it's really close. In front of them
But it's sad to think that it's in vain
But it's too late; it's time to go. It shrank
But it's too late. The wind got cold.
But Lensky, of course, did not have,
But maybe this kind of
But more often they were occupied by passions
But, my God, what a bore
But my Onegin evening is whole
But my thoughts were far away;
But neither Virgil nor Racine,
But not now. Even though I'm cordially
But nothing changed her:
But now the crowd hesitated,
But now the monument is sad
But now we see only in it
But one thought surrounds him;
But Onegin came up to her
But only with a sleepy charm
But our hero, whoever he is,
But our northern summer,
But pantaloons, tailcoat, waistcoat,
But, quietly unlocking the door,
But she can't. Can't you? But what?
But she, the sisters, did not notice,
But since it's from the back porch
But so be it: I'm on my own
But so be it: let's say goodbye amicably,
But so be it! My fate
But so be it with a biased hand
But somehow the gaze of his eyes
But soon everything changed:
But soon the guests gradually
But soon we were the fate
But suddenly Tatiana became afraid
But suddenly the snowdrift began to move.
But summer flies fast.
But sweeter, in the midst of nocturnal fun,
But Tanya couldn't cry;
But Tanya, just like in a dream,
But tea is being brought; the girls are decorous
But ten o'clock strikes; he leaves,
But that's the moonbeam
But the consequences of an unexpected meeting
But the conversation of their lovely wives
But the day has passed, and there is no answer.
But the days of the past are anecdotes
But the food was served. The couple
But the love of gentle beauties
But the north is bad for me.
But the one that I dare not
But the one who foresees everything is pathetic,
But the one who is cherished by the muse,
But the opinions of the secular stream
But the purpose of looks and judgments
But the ringing of the breguet brings them,
But the spurs did not ring,
But the waywardness of nature,
But the whispers, the laughter of fools
But their choice seemed to be
But then it was stopped,
But there are also traces of Tatiana the former
But (there are no rules without exceptions)
But there is no change in them;
But there is no friendship between us either.
But there is one in the dark mirror
But there is the same trembling in the Persians,
But there will be a lot of people there
But they say you are unsociable;
But this gaze expressed tenderness:
But this is important fun
But this passion is also accidental
But those who are in a friendly meeting
But, tired of the noise of the ball
But, to know, heartache
But to prolong my life,
But to send him to his fathers
But to young, virgin hearts
But very good-looking;
But was my Eugene happy,
But what did Tatiana think,
But what do I care?
But what was his true genius,
But whatever it is, the reader,
But where are you
But where is he now?
But where Melpomene is stormy
But who is this in the chosen crowd
But will and reason are the power
But winters are sometimes cold
But with a crimson hand
But with him, I know, it is inseparable
But without asking her advice,
But you are exhausted from the road;
But you, blessed husbands,
But you, Bordeaux, are like a friend.,
But you miss me
But you see
But you, the disparate volumes
But you, to my unfortunate lot
Buyanov drove away to Pustyakova,
Buyanov, my perky brother,
Buyanov wooed: refusal.
By candlelight, Schiller opened;
By God, a scene from a novel
By God! Not that she shuddered.
By his free vivacity.
By killing a friend in a duel,
By the Almighty will of Zeus
By the letter of my beauty;
By the name of Vladimir Lensky,
By the old lime trees, by the stream;
By the proud lyre of Albion
By the sea on the granite rocks.
By the secret will of providence,
By the way, there are two words about that here:
Calling himself to a secret court,
Calmly I got in line,
Can I imagine them
Can't hide anything.
Captured by a schoolboy prankster;
Careless and healthy?
Caricatures of all the guests.
Carry him, and the horses
Cast-iron bridges across the water
Cattle, a gray-haired couple,
Caught and glory meanwhile;
Caught the gaze of her eyes;
Caught unexpectedly by the floor,
Chairs rattle as they are pushed back;
Change was glad to have a rest.
Changed it to something else.
Changing the sweet, quiet light
Charming actresses,
Chasing love, and suddenly
Cheerful pouring out the light
Chefs prepare breakfast,
Cherished songs,
Cherries, raspberries,
Chest lifted, lanita
Children and faithful wife
Children, the yard family
Children's appointments
Chinese kettle heating;
Chu virgo
Clarice, Julia, Delphine,
Cloaks are thrown by two enemies.
Clothed in a dull romanticism
Clung quietly to the headboard?
Clutching the gun with his hand,
Cold and lazy souls?
Cold, clean, like winter,
Collecting area fables,
Combs, steel nail files,
Come, come: I am your husband!..
Come here, follow me.
Come on, honey, for God's sake.
Come to my corner more often,
Come to my golden hall!..
Commands us to reset
Comparing my features here,
Comrade, always, everywhere,
Condemned by a domineering fate:
Cornelius is a majestic genius;
Corset, album, Princess Alina,
Could appreciate his gifts,
County mothers are a joy,
County young ladies album,
Courteously, with cold clarity
Cousin, do you remember Grandison?
Crazy heart talk,
Creative dreams come alive.
Crested tails, fangs,
Crooked talk, noise and abuse!
Curtains, bridges, lawn,
Curtains, roofs and fence,
Cut in the latest fashion,
Dangerous for the heart of virgins)
Dared to clean his nails in front of him,
Dashing fashion, our tyrant,
Dawn from the morning valleys
Dear friend, I'm too old,
Dear friend, you are not well.
Dear friends, dear friends,
Debauchery used to be cold-blooded
Decayed in a quick succession,
Deceptions, gossip, rings, tears,
Deciding to hate a flirt,
Defender of liberty and rights
Delighted by the thunder of music,
Describe his outfit here;
Describe the St. Petersburg Ball;
Describing is my business:
Desires are a self-willed swarm.
Destroy preconceptions,
Devoted to Dreams immensely,
Devoting your leisure time to the innocent,
Diana's breasts, Flora's lanites
Did her heart suffer for a long time,
Did I hear your lesson?
Did not apply to her
Did their bloodlust take them away?
Did they proclaim anything,
Did you dedicate her tune?
Did you drag yourself around somehow;
Did you like soft carpets
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
Did you write poetry in secret,
Didn't I baptize you?
Didn't laugh it off somehow,
Diligently decorates it:
Direct Onegin Child-Harold
Dirty the flying sheets;
Disappointed by the other,
Divorced for a long time.
Do you speak about him?
Do you spend your evenings?
Does he speak to the Spanish ambassador?
Does not coolly shine with sharpness;
Does not lift: bursts violently
Does not reflect the face of Diana,
Does not see anyone who has a hand
Dogs rushed towards her, barking.
Don't be angry, my soul,
Don't deny it. I read it
Don't despise people in your heart;
Don't go eavesdropping
Don't go peeping
Don't laugh at them until
Don't let him say a word.,
Don't let me wander off at random.
Don't let the poet's soul cool down,
Don't you forgive her
Don't you want to? trust the expense,
Dotted with bowls all around,
Double carriage lights
Double lorgnette obliquely induces
Double windows, fireplaces
Doubts of your heart;
Drank, ate, was bored, got fat, got sick,
Drawing in fiery verses
Dreaming with him someday
Dreams are easy dreams;
Dreams, desires, sorrows
Dreams, dreams! Where is your sweetness?
Dreams have a terrible meaning
Dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Drinking a seductive deception!
Drive off into the field to the two oaks.
Driven by the external rays,
Du comme faut (Shishkov, I'm sorry:
During the days of fun and desires
During your time and mine),
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Each other with the shore. Hurray!
Eavesdrop on the heart's first sound,
Ebullient, dark and gray-haired
Eight nags were being led into the yard,
Eight Roberts have already played
Either explicitly, or surreptitiously,
Elaborate slander,
Elegies are a miserable wreath,
Elegies flow like a river.
Empty, black dreams;
(Empty nonsense, tall tales,
Enemies and friends gathered,
Enemies, friends, mistresses voice
Enemies! How long have we been apart
Enlightenment is not appropriate for us,
Enmity, hope and love,
Enmity, love, sadness and joy
Enmity sometimes
Enough for one winter,
Enough for us to follow one path
Enough, sing about something else!
Entered: and a cork in the ceiling,
Epicureans are wise men,
Eternal murmuring of the soul,
Eugene! And lighter than a shadow
Eugene could not stand it for a long time:
Eugene fell at her feet;
Eugene found out without difficulty
Eugene hasn't left yet,
Eugene, hating lawsuits,
Eugene is immediately on a date
Eugene looks at Lensky.
Eugene pushed the door open:
Eugene stood thoughtfully,
Eugene was more tolerable than many;
Eugene's fate kept him safe:
Even now.
Even scarier, even weirder:
Even though I looked in a long time ago
Even though we are innocently glad to see you.
Evening finds the mist
Everyday life of the earth:
Everyone began to interpret furtively,
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Everyone in the world has enemies,
Everyone is amazed. Lensky himself
Everyone is covered in a snowstorm,
Everyone is very impressed
Everyone sends Onegin to the doctors,
Everyone stood up: he was going to the door.
Everyone stopped being friends with him.
Everything about them is so pale, indifferent;
Everything between them gave rise to disputes
Everything calmed down: in the living room
Everything decorated the office
Everything else Eugene knew,
Everything, everything that I could express,
Everything for a gentle dreamer
Everything for the whim of the abundant
Everything gives life to a languid soul
Everything has calmed down. Tatiana is sleeping.
Everything in it is both quiet and dark;
Everything in Paris tastes hungry,
Everything in them is based on the old pattern:
Everything is bright, everything is white all around.
Everything is clapping. Onegin enters,
Everything is clear to her. A simple maiden,
Everything is full of them; everything is sweet to the virgin
Everything is gone that the sound is empty,
Everything is in Olga, but any novel
Everything is quiet. The moon is shining on her.
Everything is white Lukerya Lvovna,
Everything is yes, yes, no; he will not say yes, sir
Everything points to her,
Everything that my Onegin knew
Everything that rejoices and glitters
Everything was new to Onegin;
Everything was quiet, it was just in her,
Everything was quiet; only the night
Everything was shaking in the huge hall,
Everything was subject to their judgment.
Everywhere, everywhere in front of you
Evgeny is waiting: here comes Lensky
Excerpts from northern poems,
Excite my imagination,
Eyes like the sky, blue,
Faces flash in front of him
Factories, waters, forests, lands
Falling off the Kalmyk horse,
Fame for the baseness of the soul,
Familiar faces on the boring stage,
Families with a poor wife
Far from his own Italy.
Farewell, witness of fallen glory,
Fashionable beauties are a fashionable enemy,
Fate and life in its own way,
Fate brought me together, and so humbly
Fate has brought her into the distance,
(Fate, however, cursing),
Father and mother, in tears,
Father or old uncle,
Feather beds, cages with roosters,
Feeding the heat of the purest passion,
Fell
Fields! I am devoted to you with all my soul.
Fierce laughter rang wildly; the eyes of all,
Fiery eyes are flying,
Filled with passion and laziness
Finds it in alphabetical order
First, by mutual disagreement
First, let's prick the vanity
First of all, he was already wrong,
First of all (listen, am I right?),
First, Onegin's language
Fishing fire. In a clean field,
Five hundred years later) roads, right,
Five versts from Krasnogorie,
Flies like fluff from the mouth of Aeolus;
Flowers, love, village, idleness,
Fluff her curls according to fashion
Fluffy boa on the shoulder,
Flying album Sheets
Flying, flying; take a look back
Flying in the dust on the post office,
Flying through the flower beds to the stream.
Flying towards him on tiptoe,
Fog lay on the fields,
Follow you everywhere,
Following their captivating footsteps
Fonvizin, a friend of freedom, shone,
Fooling around; at the age of eighteen
For a few days she then
For a long time forever. It's
For a month, the mirror is pointing;
For a semi-Russian neighbor;
For a shelf of books, for a wild garden,
For a virtuous wife
For entertainment, for dreams,
For everything, for all your gifts;
For how long? Honey! Cousin!
For long or by post,
For luxury, for fashionable bliss,
For now, in the morning dress,
For now, my novel
For Olga on a wide meadow
For our poor home,
For passionate sighs and praises.
For rural silence;
For sparse, strange languages,
For sweet bliss and freedom:
For the fact that he loves without art,
For the fact that in sweet simplicity
For the fact that we are restless
For the first time with such a name
For the good, pure love
For the heart, for magazine bumps
For the heart of the Russian it has merged!
For the honor of accepting his shackles
For the mill. While away
For the noise, for the storms, for the feasts,
For the sadness, for the sweet torment,
For the sake of appearance, the price list is hanging
For the songs of the steppe, dear to her
For the sounds of life, do not spare,
For those places where the first time,
For what is Tatiana more guilty?
For your protection, please
Foreign words.
Forest shadow, the murmur of streams,
Forests and fields of solitude,
Forgetting everything for a while,
Forgetting the city, and friends,
Forgive me: I love it so much
Forgive me, my strange companion,
Forgive me, too, my freedom!
Forgotten bridges are rotting,
Forgotten. There is a familiar trail to it
Forty merry people in the yard
Four steps crossed,
Free, in the color of the best years,
Freedom-loving dreams,
Freely accepts at home,
French cuisine is the best color,
Friend, foe, I want to be with you
Friends and friendship are boring,
Friends are neighbors, their fathers.
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
Friends to quarrel with the young
Frisky, carefree, cheerful,
From a dish full of water,
From everything that is sweet to the heart,
From her lovely shoulder
From hour to hour the captive is more
From now on, I'm handing you,
From private and other debts,
From Romulus to the present day
From that side, I would have given it to her;
From the boxes and the chair rows.
From the cold debauchery of the world
From the end, from the beginning and all around.
From the hill, the lord sees a house,
From the library of devils,
From the lung of Europe,
From the Millionth there was a sudden;
From the most lullaby days,
From the mouth of Onegin. Sullen,
From the porch to the yard, and straight into the garden,
From the tableau, the list is pale
From thirty to two years old;
Frost flashed. And we are glad
Fruits of science, good and evil,
Full of love nonsense,
Full of perplexity
Full of Perplexity,
Full of sorrowful forebodings,
Fun and luxury child.
Gallicisms will be nice to me,
Galloping, mazurka, waltz Meanwhile,
Gardens, palaces are a semicircle
Gathering at night to conjure,
Gave them the Inheritance,
Gave three balls annually
Get angry or drink, and the evening is long
Get up. I must
Gets the word sideways
Getting away from everyone far away,
Getting ready, for the sake of money,
Getting rid of the wet cork,
Getting up at first light,
Girlish fainting, tears
Girls, beauties,
Girls jump ahead of time;
Give lessons in silence!
Give me a pen, a paper, nanny,
Give up hope forever.
Give you the forbidden fruit:
Go ahead, go ahead, my story!
Go away! The pillars of the outpost are already there
Go on, leave me alone.
Go to the Nevsky shores,
Go with him and with yourself
God forbid I get together at the ball
God grant his soul salvation,
God grant that in this book you
God have mercy and save us!
God knows who she's surrounded by,
God must have ordered it that way. My Vanya
Gold earrings will be torn out by force;
Golden Nights of Italy
Gone from their rebellious power,
Goodbye faithful to you;
Goodbye, Onegin, I have to go.
Got it, then the maidens look languid,
Grabs a long knife, and in a moment
Grammar, two Petriads
Great albums,
Greetings from a friend, the affection of virgins;
Grunting, the obnoxious bear falls down;
Guess after guess went on.
Guests are crowding, everyone is taking away
Guillot becomes confused.
Guillot, offers him a robe and shoes
Gulnara's singer imitating,
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov
Gvozdin, the host is excellent,
Habit has soothed grief,
Habit is given to us from above:
Had Dozed off under her pillow until morning.
Had gout at the age of forty,
Half the world has a share,
Half-crane and half-cattle.
Half-funny, half-sad,
Handsome, in full bloom,
Hanging around the guests,
Happy Dating Shelters;
Happy with the festive lunch,
Harold, a Quaker, a prude,
Has her crown withered, withered?
Has she solved the riddle?
Has the word been found?
Hates the excitement of the light;
Have a calm conversation,
Have an easy life, friends!
Have I forgotten for you for a long time
Have mercy! And it's not difficult for you
Have poets ever been tearful
Have they been leisure hours for a long time,
Have to translate Tatiana's letter.
Have you been with him just now
Have you had time to tire of infidelity;
Have you turned to your native one?
Have you written to me with such intelligence?
Having arrived home, pistols
Having come to terms with time (who knows?),
Having conceived the idea of sailing through the bosom of the waters,
Having connected, they will cross.
Having found my former ideal,
Having invented a trick and a breast
Having lived without a goal, without labors
Having lost everything irrevocably;
Having many things to do at home,
Having no high passion
Having replaced, did they not replace you?
Having served perfectly nobly,
He also began to aim , but just
He amused himself with a sweet dream
He and lyra traveled the world;
He answers her. Head
He appeared in the living rooms;
He approaches Olga Petushkov,
He approaches Olga. Quickly with her
He arrives at evening whist,
He became restless,
He began to draw in his soul
He began to raise the first one quietly.
He began to read again indiscriminately.
He believed in everything blithely,
He believed that his friends were ready
He believed that his soul was his own
He blamed himself for a lot of things:
He bowed to her in silence,
He bowed to the men from all sides,
He breathed, howled, and here she is
He brings tea on a tray.
He brought the fruits of scholarship:
He brought us to our hero
He came back and got,
He can't escape in any way;
He can't give me happiness.
He carries us for the forest and lard,
He conceded in three and a half minutes,
He considered them an empty toy
He continues the waltz with her again;
He could argue cheerfully,
He could express himself and wrote;
He could have discovered the feelings,
He couldn't do anything.
He couldn't get rid of the chorea,
He curses his madness
He dedicated one to me
He defiles the courteous answer.
He didn't allow it somehow,
He didn't die, he didn't go crazy.
He didn't like feasts.;
He didn't notice anything.
He didn't see anything in the letters.;
He didn't torment my soul like that!
He died an hour before dinner,
He distinguished himself, bravely in the mud
He does not fit the ladies to the handle;
He does not hear my grief.
He does not hear, tears from his eyes
He doesn't believe his own eyes.
He doesn't drive the cows out of the barn,
He doesn't need gold.,
He doesn't understand anything,
He drew it with a mourning taffeta.
He drinks
He drives up every day;
He drops the gun in silence,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
He enters the Princess with trepidation;
He examined it, then put it in
He excited a smile at a party
He excluded from the disgrace:
He falls asleep quietly at home
He falls into both feelings and thoughts,
He finally woke up
He finds her perfect
He finds Tatiana alone,
He flew, he's at the porch,
He flew up the marble steps,
He forced himself to respect himself
He forgot himself, the neighbor
He found a yard full of services;
He gets up from the table, rattling;
He gifted a favorite subject,
He gives me his n-quarto,
He goes away and calls people.
He goes home thoughtfully;
He got up at seven o'clock in the summer
He had a lucky talent
He had a question from the hostess.
He had fooled the light enough
He had never dreamed of it.
He had no desire to rummage
He had suffered enough of them.
He had to go with her to the regiment.
He handed it to her; she braced herself
He handed me a note from the poet.
He has a heart full of longing;
He has a tombstone madrigal.
He has forgotten features.
He has his rivals,
He hears the bear behind him,
He hears their speeches without participation,
He held me in his arms.
He held out his hand to her. Sadly
He honored the patriarchal ashes
He immediately went out; but Eugene
He involuntarily expresses himself
He is already tormented by remorse,
He is both hurt and amused,
He is disturbed by his late sleep.
He is from Germany foggy
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
He is in his first youth
He is no longer there. The younger singer
He is not tolerated by the upper class.
He is shy and impudent, and sometimes
He is welcomed. She
He keeps a deep silence.
He kept it in his memory.
He knew how to fool a fool
He knew quite a lot of Latin.,
He lay motionless, and strange
He leads her, gliding casually,
He leaves a gentle verse,
He leaves on a clear morning,
He leaves the party cramped,
He left all of you before;
He left his village,
He lies with his childish babble.
He lined the shelf with a squad of books,
He listened diligently to the young man.
He listened to Lensky with a smile.
He lives like a true sage,
He looked at the menacing flame.
He looks and sees that it's time
He looks at everything around him,
He looks at me with sweet emotion;
He looks at the empty garden
He looks at the sunken wax:
He looks, he calls him in vain:
He looks, it's already light in the room;
He looks like a dead man.
He loved the method out of feeling,
He loved the thick groves,
He loves you so much like a native!
He lurks in the deep darkness.
He needs a Don stallion,
He needs to fix his pillows,
He needs to prepare an honest coffin
He no longer fell in love with beauties,
He only dares sometimes,
He opened the door. Well, his
He painted the first snow for us
He plants cabbage like Horace,
He proudly preserved in the songs
He puts his hand gently on his chest
He raised his nose and shoulders
He ran away from their noisy conversation.
He read Gibbon, Rousseau,
He reads with his eyes
He really hit the ace with a pistol
He recently married his son.
He remembered it was time,
He renounced the light again.
He rests in the bliss of the heart,
He revived Tanya's heart.
He rewarded me with a tender caress
He rushed to her, to his Tatiana
He rushed to Taon: he is sure,
He rushes her along the forest road;
He said he was always ready.
He said: will I wait for the day?..
He said with amazement
He sang in the silence of the nights.
He sang love, obedient to love,
He sang out of tune. Splashes, clicks
He sang separation and sadness,
He sang the faded color of life
He sang those faraway countries,
He sat down at the harpsichord
He sat down, he's flying to the mill.
He sat down with a laudable purpose
He scolded Homer, Theocritus;
He scolded me a little for pranks
He searched for them without enthusiasm,
He seems like a stranger to everyone.
He sees Olga in front of him.
He sees that he is still loved;
He settled in that room,
He shared her fun,
He shone with an obedient tear!
He shot past the doorman
He showed off his evil bravery:
He showed us his hero
He sings about the Volga fishermen;
He sings all night; the rosehip blooms,
He sits down in an ice bath from sleep,
He skips, blushing.
He slept here, ate coffee,
He sometimes reads to Ole
He speaks French perfectly
He spends both day and night.
He stands with his head bowed,
He stares stubbornly: she
He starts on his way back.
He starts talking about this and that;
He still hopes, he is busy;
He stood like a magazine picture,
He stood over the river. Far away
He stopped. To an old aunt,
He stops the horse in front of him, pulling
He sulked and, indignant,
He swore to infuriate Lensky
He takes a pen; his poems,
He takes his own in distraction.
He tells the servant to get ready
He thinks: I will be her savior.
He thought to embarrass Olenka,
He turned away and yawned,
He used to be a fiery creator
He used to be still in bed:
He used to enjoy it.,
He used to sound funny.,
He visited me on Christmas Eve;
He walks between the chairs on his legs,
He wanders, and his soul
He wanted to start a conversation with her
He was a pedant in his clothes
He was a simple and kind gentleman,
He was a sucker for epigrams here,
He was a victim of violent delusions
He was able to endure with the years;
He was accepted everywhere as a groom;
He was already angry. But the maid is languid
He was already opening his vasisdas.
He was always afraid that the prankster
He was an affectionate witness
He was an ignoramus at heart, dear,
He was being chased in a noisy light,
He was bored with the light and the noise;
He was born on the banks of the Neva River,
He was born out of the dust,
He was caressed by his evil husband,
He was caught like a simpleton.
He was cheerful. Two weeks later
He was cherished by hope,
He was expecting Olga for me.,
He was famous for his love life,
He was forgotten in his hut.
He was given a general sentence.
He was immersed in his soul.
He was innocently exposing himself.
He was loved at least
He was lying on a crumpled sofa
He was much less intelligent.
He was not interested in more;
He was not stupid; and my Eugene,
He was playing the fool.
He was possessed for a moment;
He was puzzling over it
He was reviled this way and that.
He was rocking a mysterious wreath.
He was shot through the chest;
He was sick of it; nothing
He was supposed to disarm
He was very different from others
He was wearing fragrant gray hair here
He was wonderfully gentle. Is that why,
He was younger than me, my light,
He waved his hand one last time
He will captivate you, I am sure of that,
He will earn a favorable look
He will furrow his brows
He will give a sign
He will see your stern gaze
He, without ever reading,
He woke up; they brought him
He won't move, he won't die;
He won't wait for the day to end again.
He'll laugh.
He'll rub the old man's laurels!
He'll wake up in the afternoon, and again
He's a chilling word
He's a pharmacist; he drinks one
He's always with her. In her peace
He's angry, he's a gossip, he's a talker
He's been playing since morning.
He's bringing a terrible treasure home.
He's busy with his Olga.
He's calling as soon as possible. Runs in
He's chasing her like a shadow.;
He's completely forgotten us.
He's familiar to me, he's my family.
He's going home to get dressed.
He's going to bed from the ball:
He's going to shoot himself, thank God,
He's gradually stiffening up,
He's happy, he's almost healthy.
He's happy if he throws it at her
He's here! Eugene is here!
He's in the hall; next: no one.
He's leaving the yard,
He's not embarrassed by anything,
He's not here. They don't know me
He's not suffering from consumption.
He's on a two-ball pool table
He's on his way; just let him in
He's out loud, in lyrical heat,
He's paying attention every minute
He's preparing an elegy for her.
He's probably not nicer.
He's reading some kind of letter
He's so used to getting lost in this,
He's terribly unhappy.;
He's the boss there, that's clear:
He's writing a passionate message.
Head profiles flicker
Health, life color and sweetness,
Hear my sad voice:
Heavenly luminaries wondrous choir
Hedgehog, darkness, bridge, bear, snowstorm
Heeding the singing of mellifluous stanzas,
Her absent-minded laziness.
Her bow was just as quiet.
Her confidante is dear,
Her doubts are confusing:
Her dove is young,
Her embarrassment, her tiredness
Her father was a kind fellow,
Her hands, or spread them apart
Her health is the first to drink
Her heart feels tight, like an abyss
Her heart speaks louder.
Her heartfelt confession
Her husband, but in captivity;
Her impulses are beneficial,
Her infant amusements;
Her jealous longing,
Her Moscow cousin,
Her on a rickety bench
Her pampered fingers
Her passion burns stronger,
Her portrait: he is very nice,
Her sad face.
Her sister's name was Tatiana
Her touch again
Her walks last a fraction of the time.
Her younger breasts were cramped;
Herds roamed the meadows,
Here are five more steps,
Here are the Hussars on leave
Here I did not look for careless stanzas,
Here is a large salt of secular anger
Here is a skull on a goose neck
Here is his letter exactly to you.
Here is my Onegin at large;
Here is our Onegin, a villager,
Here it is: my friend, monseur Guot.
Here our hero drove up to the entrance hall;
Here, surrounded by his oak grove,
Here, take it quickly!)
Here the gentleman sat alone.
Here the mill is dancing side by side
Here the skeleton is prim and proud,
Here, to spite the spelling,
Here under the window, wearing glasses,
Here you will certainly find
Here's a cancer riding a spider,
Here's a yard boy running around,
Here's the gunpowder in a grayish trickle
Here's the morning: everyone got up a long time ago,
Here's the north, catching up with the clouds,
Here's the time: good sloths,
Hereditary enemies are like,
Heroes of Whist; eight times
Hiding from the storms at last,
High thoughts and simplicity;
Highway Russia here and here,
His abominable freedom
His beaver collar.
His blood was stirred early.
His calculating neighbor;
His daily activities
His enemies, his friends
His example to others is science;
His father couldn't understand him
His father died then.
His father lived in debt,
His fiancee gave herself up.
His handlebars made the first moan.
His horse, feeling the snow,
His involuntary devotion to Dreams,
His is full of stubborn thought.
His life is ready until morning,
His life went on peacefully;
His living tears flowed;
His love is a younger story,
His lunch and his wife.
His magic stream
His Ochakov medal!
His pen breathes love,
His raptures were expected.
His sick, faded gaze,
His silent lyre
His soul was warmed
His suffering shadow,
His unexpected appearance,
His unfeeling hand
His wife was herself
His yearning laziness,
Hisses; and so with an important posture,
Hm! Hm! The reader is noble,
Hold your lorgnette straight!
Honorary citizen of the wings,
Hooves, trunks are crooked,
Hope, there is perplexity
Hopes, pranks, dreams.
Horns and fingers are made of bone,
Hospitable antiquity.
How ardently eloquent,
How are you and I, like the whole world?
How are you, divine Omir,
How beautiful her wonderful gaze is!..
How castles should be built:
How charmed she is.
How could he forget himself!
How could he seem new,
How dandy london is dressed
How early could he be a hypocrite,
How early could he have disturbed
How firmly she has entered into her role!
How! From the wilderness of steppe villages
How full her breasts are!
How, Grandison?.. Ah, Grandison!
How he crumbled like a small demon!
How he looked like a poet,
How he was attracted to Tanya,
How his gaze was quick and gentle,
How I envied the waves,
How I made a mistake, how I was punished.
How is he, lagging behind the hustle and bustle,
How is it with your heart and mind
How is the kiss of love sweet;
How languidly silent he was,
How long has it been?
How long has it been brought to us?
How much it resonated!
How often did I play as a child
How often do I fly sometimes,
How often in a sad separation,
How often is it on the shores of Taurida
How often is the affectionate muse
How often on the rocks of the Caucasus
How Pete described himself.
How sad is your appearance to me,
How sarcastically he slandered!
How Tanya has grown up! A long time ago
How Tatiana has changed!
How, the hearts of a loving confession,
How the life of a poet is simple-minded,
How the state gets richer,
How they were written in the powerful years,
How timid is the doe of the forest,
How to get into the green forest from prison
How to keep resentment
How to lure a good fellow,
How was she dressed
How will it go, and tomorrow also,
However, he is a mountain for you:
However, it's too dark in the field;
However, the leg of Terpsichore
However, there are several creations
Howling foolishly: it's me!
Hugging each other, they cried.
Human rumor and horse top!
Hung on the branches of the oaks;
Hunters before the funeral.
Hunting for a change of places
Hunting the bonds of marriage are not enough,
Hunting to rule is a sign,
Hurriedly accelerates her step;
Hurry up! Go, go, Andrew!
Husbands of the military and the campaign.
Hymena worries, sorrows,
Hymenaeus will prepare for us
I almost divorced my husband;
I also foresee difficulties:
I also loved the spirit of his judgments,
I also saved the Mazurka
I am.
I am a member of the ancient corvee
I am awake every morning
I am bored,
I am entertained in a completely different way.
I am forever separated from her.
I am grateful with all my soul
I am no longer capable of Ai;
I am not worthy of them at all.
I am now embarking on a new path
I am ready to write to my great-grandfathers
I am temporarily fascinated by one,
I ask for your patience:
I became friends with him at that time.
I broke the lilac bushes,
I brought a frisky muse
I brought the answer solemnly.
I can barely drag my legs.
I can't resist anymore;
I can't retell it.;
I can't sleep, Nanny: it's so stuffy in here!
I can't understand. But here
I can't understand him; it bothers me
I can't understand it.
I caught it, took it by the collar
I cherish it sacredly,
I closed my eyes to the ghosts;
I could be in front of a learned light
I could have been much less colorful
I could see Tanya's confusion;
I couldn't help thinking about that;
I couldn't understand how important Makeup is
I cried bitterly out of fear,
I crossed the stream;
I danced the mazurka easily
I decorated her with dreams.
I didn 't bother with strict morals,
I didn 't give the sweet habit a go;
I didn 't repeat it godlessly afterwards,
I didn't dare to believe her:
I didn't explain myself in Russian,
I didn't have a conversation with her.
I didn't look at other books.
I didn't read it in that quick moment!
I didn't repeat it a hundred times by mistake;
I didn't trust the treacherous two.
I didn't try to blame them for that.
I didn't want to be in such agony.
I didn't want to lose it.
I didn't want to play or jump
I didn't want to stay in the share,
I didn't want to try it,
I discovered the secret as a spouse
I do not live and write for praise;
I don 't like the elements
I don't anticipate any objections.
I don't blame: in that terrible hour
I don't catch flying glory.
I don't grumble: why grumble?
I don't have time to tell you;
I don't know how to translate it.)
I don't know why)
I don't like Russian speech.
I don't read much, I sleep a long time,
I don't see any trouble here yet.
I don't see; but what's in it for us?)
I don't want to quarrel for two centuries.
I dreamed, and my soul
I enjoyed it
I feel sick, my dear:
I fell into a thoughtful laziness:
I foresee everything: you will be offended
I forgot what I knew. Yes,
I found a notebook in one of them.,
I found an untimely end!
I found it on the table,
I freeze with shame and fear
I galloped headlong through the mail
I gave a reason in the neighborhood:
I gave my word, so what? By God
I gave myself up with a full soul.
I give it to you with a bow
I go everywhere at random;
I got into five fathoms,
I got married. You must,
I got used to it and became satisfied.
I had a dreary experience.
I had lunch with him here in the winter
I had to prove myself
I have finished the first chapter;
I have known a new sadness;
I have known the voice of other desires,
I have no hopes for the former,
I have no strength to repent,
I have sometimes met myself:
I have them; here they are:
I have to admit it, I see.
I have to after a long speech
I have to be sure in the morning,
I haven 't known heartache yet,
I haven't clearly distinguished it yet.
I haven't read our magazines
I hear there are a lot of idle places.
I hold a happy stirrup in my cherished dreams
I kept a lot of things in my memory
I kept their secret image;
I knew beauties who were inaccessible,
I know: Gentle Guys
I know: in your heart there is
I know: my age has already been measured;
I know: they want to force the ladies
I know you were sent to me by God.,
I left it without finishing it to the bottom
I like your sincerity;
I liked his features,
I listened to the clerk's reports
I look at it with jealous shyness.
I looked at all the tiers,
I looked at it in great distraction,
I looked at the sun, at the clock,
I looked in twice, and there
I looked out the window and crushed flies.
(I love friendly lies
I love her, my friend Elvina,
I love my hero,
I love the frenzied youth,
I love their legs; only hardly
I love you (why lie?),
I love you with the love of a brother
I loved the Russian winter,
I marveled at their fashionable arrogance,
I mean her insignificance
I measured it with excellent accuracy,
I met Tanya at the boring aunt's,
I met you by chance sometime,
I must admit, I am glad to write too,
I notice a spark of tenderness in you,
I obey the magic bow,
I often hear the question:
I often told her about them.
I once read the instructions,
I only notice in parentheses,
I only read to the old nurse.,
I opened the door a little
I probably would have chosen you alone.
I put bee Tatana on.
I ran across her path,
I read and read, but all to no avail:
I read Apuleius willingly,
I read some of our books,
I read the first stanzas
I read the skeptical White,
I read the works of Fontenelle,
I read with secret longing
I read with spiritual eyes
I really don't know why;
I really love this word,
I remember another time!
I remember the sea before the storm:
I remember them all, and in my dreams
I remembered them for a reason.
I replaced it with a light fee;
I reviewed all this strictly:
I saluted classicism:
I saw everything: faces, headdress
I saw everything: I flared up, I'm not myself;
I shared it with the younger Semenova;
I spent time in front of mirrors
I spread my friends on the extreme trail,
I started remembering
I stayed in the frosty darkness
I stood in the yard for a long time,
I talk about feasts just as often,
I taught him everything jokingly,
I think I was better.,
I thought: freedom and peace
I thought: maybe it will go;
I took it off, undressed and went to bed
I tried to keep it in my mouth
I used to give the last poor mite. Do you remember, friends?
I used to love him myself,
I used to pee in blood
I used to walk there too:
I visited the wandering tribes,
I wander over a deserted lake,
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
I want to warn you.
I wanted to like Alban
I wanted to limit it;
I wanted to write, but it was hard work
I was already thinking about the form of the plan
I was angry, he was sullen;
I was blossoming serenely,
I was born for a peaceful life,
I was busy with Tatiana alone,
I was captivated at least for a moment.,
I was captivated: for him
I was captured: a dredge pledge!
I was crazy about balls:
I was delighting in the path of the mute
I was dissatisfied with myself.
I was floating on a dormant river:
I was flying through the dark sky
I was looking for Lensky with my eyes,
I was reading, forgetting myself, meanwhile
I was ready to sacrifice myself,
I was running after a nice fuss.
I was scared.
I was sleeping like a dead man at that time.
I was so afraid!
I was torn and cried at first,
I was worried about that.
I wasn't surprised in the morning,
I went, but I just turned around
I went to the bathhouse on Saturdays,
I will be faithful to him forever.
I will be faithful to the old days.
I will describe it to you in detail.
I will eventually report to you
I will give you details about everything,
I will give you the fruits of my labors:
I will hear your magical voice!
I will not give you jealous lorgnettes,
I will not renew my soul
I will not tolerate a corrupter
I will offer you my services;
I will pay my debt to censorship
I will portray it menacingly,
I will remember the speeches of the passionate bliss,
I will retell simple speeches
I will say without the madrigal sequins:
I will stoop to humble prose;
I will stop being a poet.,
I will undoubtedly
I will yawn silently
I wish I could bless heaven.
I wished to meet Onegin cordially
I woke up in the morning with a pleasant noise.
I would be sad to leave the world.
I would connect my friends again!
I would have chosen another one.,
I would have found a friend according to my heart,
I would have made an immodest request.
I would never have known you,
I would not give my heart!
I would not know the bitter torment.
I would prefer an offensive passion.
I would still love balls.
I would wear a quilted robe;
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
I'd like to introduce you
I'll at least give you a loan.
I'll finish it after sometime.
I'll go down into the mysterious canopy,
I'll lead them down the aisle.
I'll note by the way: all poets
I'll pay you back for it.
I'll quarrel again, and finally
I'll take a look at the house, at this garden.
I'm afraid: in my humble prayer
I'm afraid: lingonberry water
I'm always happy to notice the difference.
I'm asking you to leave me;
I'm bringing you to a social event;
I'm coming! It's scary to reread
I'm crazy about Richardson.
I'm crying if your Tanya
I'm crying in front of you,
I'm crying with you now;
I'm embarrassed by regret;
I'm enjoying the breeze
I'm falling for you, my poets;
I'm finally alone,
I'm free, I'm looking for an alliance again
I'm giving myself up to you for judgment.
I'm going to be possessed by a new demon,
I'm in love with Tatiana like a child;
I'm no good at anything.
I'm not coming. And she's still sad,
I'm not going to enjoy myself on the outside,
I'm not used to postal prose.
I'm out of here, immersed in the duma,
I'm ready to break out every hour.
I'm ready to cry, I'm ready to cry!..
I'm shooting with a friend.
I'm singing a younger friend
I'm sorry, heavenly beauty,
I'm still condemned to love:
I'm still sad; but there are no tears anymore,
I'm sure being a soul,
I'm swimming, dear friends!
I'm through a magic crystal
I'm waiting for you: with one eye
I'm writing to you, what's more?
I've accepted the receptions soon!
I've already chosen him over him.
I've already given up my fate.
I've become clueless now.
I've been fighting with the housekeeper for forty years,
I've been putting up with ballets for a long time,
I've been waiting impatiently for a long time;
I've ruined a lot of my life!
I've seen him, and I haven't seen him at all
I've seen other freaks,
I've stopped loving reading for a long time,
Ice skates soundly cuts the ice;
If only he knew what kind of wound it was
If only I had the power,
If only I were like you, a poet.
If you were still with me,
Illuminated by Diana's ray,
Imagination is boiling again,
Imagine: I'm here alone,
Imagining herself to be a heroine?
Immature and withered years,
Immersed in her dreams,
Implacable, incorruptible,
Impulses of a virgin dream
In a circle of decent people,
In a frozen bottle for a poet
In a moment that was evil for him,
In a paper cap, more than once
In a sheepskin coat, in a red sash.
In a sweatshirt, in an old hat.
In a village without big vanities:
In addition, taking more for them
In all albums, blunted,
In all her sorrows , he gives her
In both hearts, the heat faded;
In caps and roses, they look evil;
In caravans, in chaises and in sleighs.
In careless bliss, not counting,
In carriages heavily loaded,
In chronological dust
In cold blood,
In duels, the classic and the pedant,
In fluff, in a cap with a visor
In foreign words,
In front of her in the hall, and all above
In front of him, roast beef is bloody,
In front of the darkened houses
In front of the spouse of the coffin door,
In front of the young mistress
In glasses, in a tattered caftan,
In heartfelt letters, how careless!
In her confusion, Tanya was in a hurry,
In her proud face
In him, the ardor of the soul would have cooled.
In his face? Why is he here?
In his wheelchair, discharged
In his wilderness, the sage is desolate,
In home life, we see one
In it, the thoughts were outraged by a swarm;
In its frowning glory;
In jealous indignation
In love, being considered an invalid,
In love, poor and simple,
In love to the grave;
In many ways, he would have changed,
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
In my soul, in my blood!
In my wandering destiny,
In Olga Molodoy's album;
In order to have breakfast with the three of them,
In short: Russian melancholy
In such a year, such a year.
In such an album, my friends,
In that pile, see? ahead,
In the Academic Dictionary.
In the anguish of heartfelt remorse,
In the anguish of insane regrets
In the anguish of love thoughts
In the attic, born a liar
In the bosom of rural silence!
In the color of joyful hopes,
In the confusion of tender shame,
In the deadening rapture of light,
In the depths of my soul,
In the desert, where Eugene is alone
In the evening, sometimes they converged
In the excitement of his stormy thoughts,
In the eyes of her parents, she
In the face of the blowing spring
In the fields, the noise of work has stopped;
In the fruitless dryness of speeches,
In the good heat of moralizing,
In the grave, in the damp mother earth!
In the high London circle
In the hut, singing, the maiden
In the impulses of his heart,
In the last century, the belated;
In the last taste of the toilet
(In the likeness of this)
In the maid's garden, on the ridges,
In the midst of a poetic dream
In the midst of seductive networks.
In the morning, the Larins' house is visited
In the morning, the whitewashed courtyard,
In the northern, sad snow
In the old days, they triumphed
In the philosophical desert
In the rain of passions, they are fresh,
In the remote, distant side,
In the serene deserts of the sky,
In the shade of a protective oak grove
In the shade of two outdated pines.
In the sky on the left side,
In the snowdrifts in front of her
In the spring on the grasslands,
In the spring, with the clicks of the swan,
In the sun and on a frosty day,
In the taste of smart antiquity.
In the transparent darkness, he flashed,
In the very morning of our days.
In the village, happy and horny,
In the village where Eugene is mine,
In the wilderness, a lyrical voice is more sonorous,
In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,
In the wilderness of a forgotten village
In the wilderness of Moldova sad
In the wilderness, under the shadow of a humble,
In the wilderness, what to do at this time?
In the window through the frozen glass
In their fields she meets
In their house these evenings:
In their translation, he hates,
In this case, he is completely wrong.
In this majestic, in this careless
In this pool, where am I with you
In this stupid sky.
In this tedious walk
In those days in the mysterious valleys,
In those days when in the gardens of the Lyceum
In which the author knows more
In winter in the dark of the nights
In winter, on the cast iron fireplace,
In winter, when the night shadow
In your narrow footsteps,
In your native language,
Inaccurate pronunciation of speeches
Incessantly with magical power
Incomplete, weak translation,
Incomprehensible to the mind;
Inconsiderate friends,
Incorrect, careless babbling,
Indignation, regret,
Indulged in the red summer days
Inexperience leads to trouble.
Infuriate a misguided enemy;
Inimitable strangeness
Innocent charm is full,
Innocent conversations are flowing
Innocent outpouring of love;
Innocent years of prejudice
Inquiries, gossip and news
Insomnia, light inspirations,
Inspected, re-upholstered, reinforced
Inspiration was beating in this heart,
Inspiring love is a disaster for them,
Instant flame covered,
Instantly doused with cold,
Instead of bristling like an animal;
Interpretation of other people's quirks,
Interprets Sey and Bentham,
Interrupting the conversation that started,
Into a spring sunken flower;
Into conversations, into a general conversation;
Into oblivion he whispers by heart
Into the alley, right in front of her,
Into the bushes of the fallen shooter.
Into the fields, friends! Hurry up, hurry up,
Into the fire, then a shoe, then a magazine.
Into whom?
Intoxicated with the last happiness,
Introduce me.
Invents for fun,
Invisible, you were too sweet to me,
Involuntarily he looks in the mirror
Involuntarily, my dears,
Involuntarily, or out of good will,
Involuntary affection to expect,
Irresistible rays
Is he still the same or has he been pacified?
Is it helpful for our yard?
Is it more tolerable for you
Is it not a parody?
Is it not because in high society
Is it not because my shame
Is it possible? Just a little out of diapers,
Is it really finally
Is it really him?.. That's right, he is.
Is it really straight and true
Is it silent and foggy?
Is it striking with such force?
Is more reliable than friendship and kinship:
Is Olga frisky yours?
Is Onegin striving? You are in advance
Is she really? But for sure
Is that really the same Tatiana,
Is there a full vocabulary of fashionable words?..
Is there a killing every night?
Is this your lot
Is to get behind the run-down fashion.
Is your whole family healthy?
Isn't everything in Russian
Isn't it true? All her family
Isn't it true: cute objects,
Isn't it true? I've heard you:
Isn't it true? It wasn't news to you
Isn't that right, friend? Not at all. Where to!
Isn't that you, sweet vision,
Istomina is standing; she,
It all meant, friends:
It: And, full of living truth,
It began to beat more often and more strongly.
It came, scattered; in clumps
It certainly wasn't Grandison.
It changes every spring.
It clouds the delicate eyes.
It confused me; but I'm used to it
It depicts death, not agony.
It did not come out of his pen,
It does not take away from greedy lips
It felt like it was bursting.
It flies from the wax cell.
It flows so quietly, so according to
It glitters and curls; but the bed
It goes down the pipe. Light Cup
It grows, worries, boils
It has already come to him unbearably.
It has been silenced forever.
It hasn 't faded yet,
It ignited the blood in the withered heart,
It is a substitute for happiness.
It is also brought to the Assembly.
It is being prepared jokingly
It is between the printed lines
It is covered with desert snow,
It is depicted quite correctly
It is different to repeat one thing,
It is even more pleasant to be silent
It is extremely durable and calm
It is important to try to assure that,
It is impossible in any way; impatiently
It is like a windy hope,
It is monotonous and variegated.
It is silvered with frosty dust
It is still new to us,
It is the will of heaven: I am yours;
It is with its play and foam
It makes noise, swirls with its own wave
It oozed and immediately put it down
It reminded me of at least one sound.
It retains the same tone,
It seemed that she was almost alive,
It sparkles and sparkles;
It stalled. There is no wreath on the branch;
It stands like a menacing shadow,
It stretched to the south: it was approaching
It takes you out with the sun behind it
It took hold of him little by little;
It tormented her like a heavy dream.
It touches the earth!
It turns out that he demands a horse
It turns pale, goes out and is silent!
It was a pleasant, noble one,
It was a tempting mystery,
It was already burning, smoking, across the river
It was already November at the yard.
It was brought to the table immediately.
It was completely deepened.
It was evening. The sky was fading. Water
It was, friends, Martin Zadeka,
It was getting dark; on the table, shining,
It was not there: as before,
It was only covered with a mortal pallor
It was simple: the floor was oak,
It was so sweetly distorted,
It was usually served
It wasn't part of her plan,
It will catch you suddenly, then out of your ears
It will hardly be pleasant for you.
It will not be important to disassemble,
It will take my merry sunset.
It will teach us grammar;
It would be suitable in an epigram)
It would have been a long time ago (wouldn't it?) It's time!
It would have been time to find it long ago,
It would not have attracted the eyes.
It's a pity I don't have the time to drive around.;
It's a pretty boring time;
It's a wonderfully molded pattern
It's all in the wilderness; he's everywhere
It's all settled: I'm at your will
It's already been solved. Careless,
It's already dark: he's getting into the sled.
It's been a long time since a heartache
It's been a long time since her imagination,
It's been a long time since we left the yard.
It's been three hours at least
It's black and noisy under it
It's called idag. (I can't
It's Christmas Eve. That's the joy!
It's clearer now
It's dark in the valley. The grove is sleeping
It's easy to shine here.
It's excusable. Evgeniy,
It's for the evening. God! to her!..
It's getting clearer through the steam. There's a stream
It's in my stomach,
It's like a cold hand
It's like I'm dreaming
It's like sleeping at night,
It's like they're busy.
It's like they're turning green.
It's more charming than anything to me.
It's my turn today.
It's nice to see how stubborn he is
It's nicer if he's friends,
It's no wonder to keep up everywhere.
It's not good for a housewarming party,
It's not the first time he's shown up here
It's sad to bring medicine,
It's spilling onto the shelf. Toothed,
It's still cocked. For the near stump
It's strange to her. I have devoted myself to honor
It's time between the wolf and the dog,
It's time for Eugene,
It's time for hopes and tender sadness,
It's time for me to become smarter,
It's time for the festivities of inspired
It's time for warmth, flowers, and work,
It's time, it's time!
It's time, it's time for her to get married!..
It's time, it's time to go home.
It's time, my child, get up:
It's time, she fell in love.
It's time to get a girl, she-she, It's time; but what should I do with her? It's the same thing for everyone
It's time to get up: it's past seven.
It's time to leave boring breg
It's too late; time has flown away
It's unbearable to see in front of you
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
Its empty purpose is pathetic;
Its seal is cut-out.
Its with a disparate
Ivan Petrovich is just as stupid,
Ivan Petushkov too.
Jam, eternal conversation
Jam in jars, mattresses,
Jealous without worrying about the flour,
Jealousy and annoyance disappeared
Joking innocence amaze,
Joking, judging is not without sin,
Judge what kind of roses
Jugs of apple water
Julia Volmar's lover,
Jumps, heels, mustache
Just a boat waving its oars,
Just along the main road
Just like in the Vandik's Madonna:
Just so you can hear him).
Just to hear your speeches,
Just to spend time,
Keep thinking, thinking about one thing
Keeping at least a drop of pity,
Keeps silent meanwhile
Keeps talking about him. Bothering her
Keeps the hopes of a dark dream;
Killed by a friendly hand!
Killed!.. With this terrible exclamation
Kiss her, gently shake her hands,
Kissing the mouths of the younger Armids,
Labors in vain without ruining,
Languid eyes are raised to the moon,
Languishing and windy success,
Languishing in idle leisure
Languishing in mental emptiness,
Lanterns are shining everywhere;
Latin is out of fashion now:
Lay down at her feet with love!
Lay down in wavy carpets
Leaf by leaf sorting through,
Leaning on her elbows, Tatiana writes,
Leaning on his hand with his cheek.
Leaning on the dam, Lensky
Leaning on the table, sometimes
Learn to control yourself;
Leave the restless hail,
Leaving a cup of tea with rum,
Lensky called his friend to a duel.
Lensky does not write madrigals
Lensky dozed off quietly;
Lensky fell an unfortunate victim
Lensky is defeated; the shadows are terrible thickened;
Lensky is unable to bear the blow;
Lensky replied to the old woman,
Lensky was behind her; the light flashed;
Lensky was distracted all evening,
Lepage's trunks are fatal
Leprosy, occasional weakness
Let him live for now
Let him write further than me.
Let me introduce you:
Let me look around. Excuse me, seni,
Let me sprinkle with holy water,
Let's chase the naughty rhyme,
Let's forgive the fever of youth
Let's go.
Let's go, do me a favor!
Let's go home around the garden;
Let's go listen to the oakwood noise
Let's go to rest together
Let's go to them; you will oblige them;
Let's go to where the stream is,
Let's have lunch soon!
Let's push back more boundaries,
Let's run away, dear ones,
Let's talk about the old days.
Letter: Prince N humbly requests
Lies bright, boundless;
Life is so disgusting in old age
Life was playing, blood was boiling,
Like a baby's dream, like the moon
Like a drunk, and the French
Like a drunken traveler at night,
(Like a love dream, another prank)
Like a majestic moon,
Like a series of annoying ghosts.
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
Like a shadow, she wanders aimlessly,
Like a true Frenchman, in your pocket
Like a verse without a thought in a fashionable song,
Like a victim, magnificently decorated
Like a windy Venus,
Like an annoying separation,
Like at a big funeral;
Like Bogdanovich's poems.
Like Byron, the poet of pride,
Like Chatsky, from the ship to the ball.
Like Chd-Harod, sullen, languid
Like Delvig drunk at a feast.
Like everything in the world, tired of;
Like in a terrible, incomprehensible dream,
Like leaves rotten in autumn.
Like rosy lips without a smile,
Like smoke across the blue sky,
Like storms in the fields:
Like the heat, with golden crosses
Like the sins of the past youth,
Like the thoughts of a simple-minded virgin,
Like the whirlwind of a young life,
Like the women, he left the books,
Like this stupid moon
Like your waist,
Listen to me without anger:
Listening in the noise and in the silence
Listening to the new noise of the forests;
Listening to their sonorous voice,
London trades scrupulously
Long live Bordeaux, our friend!
Longing and rhyming torment,
Longing for love,
Long-silenced feelings;
Look after your daughters:
Looking at them, he says:
Looking down in annoyance,
Lord Byron by a lucky whim
Love captivating dreams
Love has passed, the muse has appeared,
Love is a dreamy friend.
Love is a tempting violet,
Love is crazy suffering
Love, like a sweet child.
Love the insane anxiety
Love yourself,
Lovelace's dilapidated glory
Lovely, dear friends!
Loving the young man with all my heart,
Lower than the signatures of others
Lucky man, he did not shame:
Lunch is quite whimsical,
Lunch won't ring for him.
Lure the young man
Lying in bed with a book,
Madame de Stae, Bichat, Tissot,
Madman, will you forget them?
Magazines heeding the pleading voice,
Magical sounds, feelings and thoughts;
Maids from all over the yard
Make acquaintance shorter.
Malek-Adele and de Linard,
Malice awaited both of them
Many, many days have passed
Manzoni, Herder, Chamfort,
Marriage will be a torment to us.
Martin Zadeka became later
Martin Zadeka will not decide;
Mature young ladies idol,
May God's thunder burn you!
May the world believe in perfection;
Maybe he's for the good of the world.
Maybe I did it:
Maybe I'm giving you an excuse!
Maybe it won't sink in the Summer
Maybe it's all empty,
Me with tears of spells
Meadows and fields of gold,
Meanwhile, he doesn't take his eyes off her
Meanwhile, Onegin's appearance
Meanwhile, rural cyclopes
Meanwhile, the goal of the ode is high
Meanwhile, the mechanic is rustic,
Meanwhile, two, three pages
Meanwhile, we, the enemies of Hymen,
Meanwhile, with a feigned cold
Meets the morning of the year through a dream;
Melancholy was waiting for him on guard,
Memories of previous years novels,
Men are against; and, crossing themselves,
Merchants, hovels, men,
Military dandies, diplomats
Mind not heeding strict penalties,
Mine! Yevgeny said menacingly,
Modern (by calculation
Monotonous and insane,
Monotonous nudity.
Monseur Abbe, a poor Frenchman,
Monseur was chased out of the yard.
Monsieur Triquet also arrived,
Monsters are sitting all around:
Morality makes us sleepy,
More cupids, devils, snakes
More gentle than a pipe tune:
More longing, more love!..
More outside and inside
More sincere than the other.
More tired footmen
More worthy than a beautiful soul,
Moscow dandies and circuses
Moscow how much is in this sound
Moscow, I was thinking about you!
Moscow kneeling
Mother Winter's pranks.
Mourned by his neighbor,
Movements, voice, light stance,
Mustache, bloody tongues,
My boiling youth
My cousin's brother, Buyanov,
My dead mother-in-law.
My dear reader!
My dear Tatiana
My dear Tatiana!
My family and my friend.
My fashion house and evenings,
My father blessed me.
My flying creations,
My friends, what's the use of that?
My friends, you feel sorry for the poet:
My gaze catches him in vain,
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
My happiest days?
My heart will not tremble, even for a joke.
My joy is heavy now,
My mind is exhausted,
My mother begged; for poor Tanya
My mother's lessons.
My Onegin has already galloped.
My poet takes Tambov,
My poor Lensky! Beyond the grave
My poor Lensky, he
My poor Lensky! languishing,
My progress in the vortex of light,
My soul is alien to him;
My soul will completely calm down:
My student cell
My stupid student.
My sweet dreamer,
My Tatiana doesn't care.
My Tatiana understand
My Tatiana's heart was burning!
My uncle has the most honest rules,
My uncorrected weirdo.
My whole life has been a pledge
My windy friend.
My younger days were rushing by.
N. N. is a wonderful person.
Napoleon waited in vain,
Native people are like that:
Nature is tremulous, pale,
Nature than Chateaubriand,
Nature was waiting for winter.
Nature with a clear smile
Near Olga, he plunged into the duma,
Near the waters that shone in silence,
Near unfinished poems,
Neater than a fashionable parquet
Necessary fools;
Neglected in a humble way,
Neighbors are a kind family,
Neither a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
Neither by the freshness of her rosy
Neither moths nor bees.
Neither Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneca,
Neither sharpness nor intelligence,
Night will come; the moon is going around
No areal epigrams,
No art dorms;
No cards, no balls, no poetry.
No common opinions, no passions.
No cooling distance,
No female legs, no heads;
No foreign beauties,
No gossip of the world, no Boston,
No: his feelings cooled down early;
No, I see you every minute,
No long summers of separation,
No longer love; as one
No matter how hard he fights, even if he dies.
No matter how hard we fought, to distinguish.
No matter how much I love you,
No matter how strong she was
No, more than a joyless passion
No, my Moscow didn't go
No, never a rush of passion
No, never in the heat of the day
No noise of fun, no science
No one could have found it in her
No one could have made her beautiful
No one else was looking for a bride.
No one has opened it yet.
No one is listening, they are shouting,
No one remembers, much less
No one understands me,
No one was so interested:
No service, no wife, no business,
No songs inspired by them:
No sweet fictions of the poet,
No tube of fashion connoisseurs
No wise truths, no paintings,
Noise, laughter, crush at the doorstep,
Noise, laughter, running, bowing,
Not a ball of speculation,
Not a holiday, not an adopted gift,
Not an ardent boy, a fighter,
Not because Grandison
Not because I read it.,
Not cold, not talkative,
Not even a Ladies Fashion Magazine
Not everyone will understand you like me.;
Not for a long time, it wasn't a dream!
Not her sister's beauty,
Not knowing how to understand it,
Not knowing what to start with fear,
Not on the post office, on their own,
Not only sadness, my soul,
Not reflected by anything;
Not rejecting anything:
Not respecting the heart in him,
Not seeing a bit of sense here,
Not smiling faces;
Not the torments of secret villainy
Not thinking to amuse the proud light,
Not this timid girl,
(Not to mention poems);
Not to the muses of this watch,
Not with him yet, not with you,
Not with poetic fire,
Not without sighing,
Not yet aiming, two enemies
Not you, with joy and love,
Notes on six sheets,
Nothing interests her,
Nothing touched him,
Nothing was spared in him:
Noticing that Vladimir had disappeared,
Noticing the trembling impulse,
Now friends are talking:
Now from you, my friends,
Now he is immersed in his heart!
Now I have to come;
Now, I know, in your will
Now I see what it is:
Now I would be noticed by everyone,
Now I wouldn't recognize the princess!
Now I'm ready to give up.
Now, in advance, triumphant,
Now it's a hillock, then a stream
Now it's a holiday for the jealous one!
Now it's kind and simple
Now it's like an empty house,
Now it's not that: and we, as ladies,
Now let's eavesdrop stealthily
Now our roads are bad,
Now she's in a hurry to go to the fields
Now she's resurrected in her again.
Now silent, now cheerful again;
Now the doubts are solved:
Now we have something wrong in the subject:
Now we're going to fly to the garden,
Now what kind of attention is she paying
Now you need to find out from me,
Nurtured in oriental bliss,
O people! You all look alike
O you epic muse!
O you, whose memory will preserve
Obedient to the attraction of feeling,
Obnoxious, though innocent nonsense;
Of course, he did not shine with any feeling,
Of course it is. But the whirlwind of fashion,
Of course it would be brave,
Of course, not only Eugene
Of course, there must be contempt
Of course, you've seen it more than once
Of daily pleasures? Was he in the midst of feasts
Of her beloved creators,
Oh, a lot, a lot of rock has gone away!
Oh, Brenta! No, I'll see you.
Oh, darling, how prettier you are
Oh fear! No, it's better and truer
Oh, I will, I will! And soon
Oh legs, it's full of mistakes!
Oh, legs, legs! Where are you now?
Oh, listen, Lensky; but you can't
Oh, my early bird!
Oh, my easy youth!
Oh my God! What did he think!
Oh, nanny, nanny! Before that?
Oh, nanny, nanny, I'm longing,
Oh, she's a gray-haired Filipyevna
Oh, the news, but what!
Oh, there is no power
Oh, who would mute her suffering
Oh, you honorable spouses!
Ohtenka is in a hurry with the jug,
Old age is guessing through glasses
Old chapters are burning.
Old Derzhavin noticed us
Old stories, tall tales
Olenka jumped off the porch,
Olenka yawned behind him,
Olga has no life in her features.
Olga has shoulders, what a chest!
Olga will be ordered to make tea,
Olga's admirer has arrived.
Olga's smile is encouraging,
Oligarchic conversations,
On a dead soul for a long time
On a skinny and shaggy nag
On an inflamed tongue.
On blue, excised ice
On Saturday. Olenka and mother
On the branches of a bowed pine tree,
On the buzzword ideal
On the charms of her steppe
On the cold panes breathing,
On the day of Trinity, when the people,
On the first leaf you meet
On the foggy glass
On the leash,
On the lies of magazines, on the war,
On the monogram, given to two sisters,
On the plane of the ladies, on the tone of the men,
On the rumors about the misty novel,
On the third in the night. Waking up early,
On the third there is a grove, a hill and a field
On three roan horses;
Once I get used to it, I'll fall out of love immediately;
Once in a real rapture
One breathing, one loving,
One day to them in solitude
One foot touching the floor,
One habitual sadness.
One habitual wish,
One moment ago
One more thing separated us
One, underneath, is gray-haired and frail
One wanders with a dangerous book,
One went home to sleep.
One with horns and a dog's face,
Onegin asked Lensky:
Onegin begins to turn pale:
Onegin comes with an apology.
Onegin could not find it.
Onegin, do you remember that hour,
Onegin dries up and barely
Onegin fired a shot
Onegin fixed his sharp gaze:
Onegin flew to the theater,
Onegin from the first movement,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
Onegin, grinning,
Onegin, his eyes sparkling,
Onegin, I saw you,
Onegin, I was younger then,
Onegin (I'll take care of him again),
Onegin is counting the clock again,
Onegin is in a hurry to get dressed,
Onegin is in a hurry to see the young man,
Onegin is quietly captivating
Onegin is sitting at the table
Onegin is surely waiting for us.
Onegin listened with an important air,
Onegin lived an anchorite:
Onegin locked himself in at home,
Onegin, my good friend,
Onegin. Oh, my God, my God!
Onegin opened the cupboards;
Onegin, secretly grinning,
Onegin sleeps deeply for himself.
Onegin talked about them
Onegin was amazed,
Onegin was in the opinion of many
Onegin was ready with me
Onegin was silent about everything;
Onegin was vividly touched:
Onegin waved his hand,
Onegin, we are being driven by boredom again,
Onegin went to the window
Onegin went with Olga;
Onegin's letter to Tatiana
Onegin's soul is everywhere
Only a nanny would know,
Only Tanya's heart is not happy with her.
Open the window and sit down with me.
Or a brooding Vampire,
Or a dove on the lyre
Or a dull gaze will not find
Or a fast hare between the fields
Or a girl's! We all have to
Or a heavy dream break,
Or a long tale of living nonsense,
Or a sad madcap,
Or a satanic freak,
Or a staged Freischitz
Or an insidious tempter:
Or at least he was born for fame;
Or Baratynsky's pen,
Or (but this is no joke),
Or do mo and dropped
Or even himself in a passionate annoyance
Or even my demon.
Or grammatical errors,
Or having known it from afar
Or he didn't become a poet.
Or is he also acting like a weirdo?
Or is it time for tears soon?
Or is pleasure alien to me,
Or it will fly by,
Or it will touch you hotly
Or just be a good guy,
Or kiss the edge of your clothes.
Or letters from a young virgin.
Or maybe even that: the poet
Or Melmoth, the gloomy tramp,
Or, more gently, like a moth,
Or, not happy about the return
Or not, sir. That was the general voice.
Or offends, or makes you laugh,
Or over the Summer euthanized
Or percy, full of longing;
Or quiet to share leisure time.
Or rather, there is no place for confessions
Or rather, we'll start it online;
Or roses of flaming lanit,
Or send congratulations by mail,
Or she delighted me with prayer
Or she suddenly became pale, red
Or shone, my reader;
Or some other trifle
Or some publisher
Or someone else flaunts a mask,
Or the Eternal Jew, or the Corsair,
Or the handkerchief will lift it up.
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Or to make them reconcile
Or was he flirting, playing pranks,
Or when driving on the porch
Or with a lively nature
Or with an academician in a cap!
Order is an enemy and a waster,
Other, cold dreams,
Other lines. He's in them.
Other people's and their own victories,
Other, strict concerns
Others even claimed,
Others follow them
Others galloped off,
Otherwise, I used to be very,
Otherwise, my friend, you judge for yourself:
Otherwise, she would have driven me out of the world
Our Eugene conceived it first
Our games are girlish.
Our language is still proud
Our sad rhymers?
Our threes are indefatigable,
Our time will come, our time will come,
Our Zaretsky is an honest fellow
Out the jealous whispers of fashionable wives.
Outside the gate. Every other day
Over my poor nurse
Owning weakly and with difficulty,
Paintings will not attract you:
Palaces, gardens, monasteries,
Pale as a shadow, dressed in the morning,
Paris county towns,
Parted with the muses, got married,
Passes with youth alive.
Patches of snow; through the peaks
People are sacred friends;
People I don't judge,
People's tears, applause
Perfume in faceted crystal;
Perhaps (a flattering hope!),
Perhaps by the will of heaven,
Perhaps it occurs to us
Perhaps on the banks of the Neva
Perhaps on the steps of light
Perhaps she took it with her
Perhaps the feeling is old-fashioned
Perhaps to my misfortune,
Petrarch marching after,
Petrovsky Castle. He's gloomy.
Petrovsky Castle. Well! Don't stand there,
Pharmacies, fashion stores,
Philosophical tables,
Phoblas is a long-time student,
Picking berries in the bushes
Pity was born in his soul:
Plates and cutlery rattle
Play it out girls,
Play with a developed curl
Please accept my thanks,
Please notice my speech:
Pleased with his lot,
Pleased with his revenge.
Plunging into dreams, she;
Poems have been preserved in case;
Poems of the Russian mechanism
Poems will be put into use;
Poems without measure, according to tradition
Poetry and prose, ice and fire
Poetry is a sacred delusion,
Poetry is alive and clear,
Pompous, but hungry
Poor Tatiana is not sleeping
Poor Tatiana is on fire;
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
Portraits of kings on the walls,
Pots, basins et cetera,
Pots, chairs, chests,
Pour champagne over a bottle
Pour out pleas, confessions, penalties,
Pour the hot fat over the cutlets,
Pranks, jokes of former years.
Prayers, vows, imaginary fear,
Premonitions pressed against my chest.
Present clear features
Priests and guests ate and drank
Privacy, silence,
Proroem impudent vaults,
Protected from the winds by a mountain,
Provincial and simpering,
Provincial simplicity,
Prudent silence,
Pull the trigger on each other
Purring, he washed his snout with his paw:
Push the mountains apart, under water
Put them back in the drawer and undressed,
Put through the stream;
Putting a bug in the sled,
Quecrrez-ous sur ces tabettes,
Quietly ordered in the bathhouse
Quite. Off with the burden!
Read: Here's Pradt, here's W. Scott.
Read in Russian. Really, fear!
Read into the eyes of your dear ones
Reader, we will leave now,
Reading a sweet novel,
Ready to ask her forgiveness,
Ready to do us a favor
Ready to relive the bond,
Ready to slap entrechat,
Recently, he is proud of his fame.
Recognition is also without art;
Red currant.
Reduced, continued.
Reeez ous, bee endorme.
Regretting the old, about the past:
Relatives who arrived from afar,
Remember what the satirist said!
Remembering the old love,
Replacement of dim lights.
(resolute and strict judges)
Resolve my doubts.
Rest from labors,
Rest in peace, young poet!
Returned to his penates,
Revel in it for now,
Revive the hopes of the heart
Revive the slumber of the heart,
Rich, handsome, Lensky
Right up to the girlish. Everyone needs it
Ringing pitchers are coming;
Rousseau (I'll note in passing)
Running in a stormy line
Rural freedom has
Rushes along the Neva River in a sleigh.
Rushing, he wants to scream:
Rushing through the fields alone,
Rushing uphill at full speed;
Sad about an unworthy husband,
Sad is the dead trail of passion:
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
Salted mushrooms for the winter,
Sang of children's fun,
Satan is joking with love.
Satires the bold lord,
Saving the honor of the native land,
Say a word to you, and then
Saying goodbye to bars. And so
Saying goodbye to the young virgin,
Scare with desperation ready,
Scaring a herd of wild ducks:
Scaring people is a joy for them.
Scaring timid love,
Scream meets them in the living room
Screaming: Yes, stop crying,
Secluded fields,
Secret sleigh rides;
Secrets are heartfelt, secrets of virgins,
Securely screwed flint
Sed aa tempora! Audacity
(See the first notebook)
Seeing the terrible harm in this,
Seething with impatient hostility,
Selfish and dry,
Selfish insignificance
Selfishly indifferent
Semyon Petrovich is also stingy,
Send greetings, congratulations;
Send your grandson.
Sensing him, the road horse
Sensing the dead, they snore
Sensitive, careless again,
Sensitive poems notebook
Separation, tears of reconciliation,
Set the table for two sets;
Shadows walk across the solid windows,
Shaking his head importantly,
Shared it amicably? Now it is malicious,
Sharing feelings with the crowd,
Sharpened the lily stalk;
She appeared as a young lady of the district,
She appeared to him every day,
She baptized with an old hand.
She beat the maids angrily
She called Polina Praskovya
She came back early in the morning
She came in and sat by the window.
She came running noisily. Not without a fight
She can't see it, or she's not sorry;
She can't sleep in her new bed,
She carried her gifts
She coughed in tears.
She could have raised it for centuries. The poet,
She could pronounce it through her nose;
She couldn't make out
She couldn't outshine her neighbor,
She did not enliven the canvases.
She didn't cry for long.
She didn't even move an eyebrow.;
She didn't even press her lips together.
She didn't play with the burners,
She didn't speak Russian well.,
She does not distinguish her fields:
She does not notice the dawn,
She does not say: let's postpone
She doesn't dare; she ran around in a flash
She doesn't listen to the guests
She doesn't move her soul.
She doesn't notice him.,
She doesn't pick it up
She dreams that she is
She drove me to listen to the noise of the sea,
She fell in love with deceptions
She fell into the snow; the bear was nimble
She forgot: she started calling
She gave birth to a lot of nonsense,
She gave it to the poet
She gets out of bed.
She goes out in an open dress,
She got up by candlelight.
She greets two friends
She has a heart full of torment,
She has no time to lift; she is afraid,
She is between business and leisure
She is disturbed by a dream.
She is grabbed and carried;
She is humble tents
She is in front of a cold crowd,
She is insensitively submissive,
She is Lenore, in the moonlight,
She is plunged into despondency,
She is prone to counter-speech.
She is round, her face is red,
She is shamefacedly under the crown
She is sweet with careless charm,
She is the Epiphany cold!
She is trembling and bursting with heat,
She is unfaithful to her sadness.
She is well; they told me to bow.
She kept expenses, shaved foreheads,
She knows no deception
She knows the trick,
She lay down. Lel is hovering over her,
She leaned her head to his shoulder,
She leaned on her trembling hand
She leveled it with a plump veil;
She liked him much more:
She liked novels early on;
She likes the order slim
She looks and the heart is in her
She looks at his face.
She looks: forgotten in the hall
She looks quietly through the crack,
She loved on the balcony
She loved Richardson.
She made me nervous.
She must hate him.
She, not daring to look back,
She opened a feast of young ideas,
She preferred Lovelace;
She, prophesying to the gaze
She rode a horse with me!
She runs, he follows her,
She said: It's him!
She said quietly through her teeth
She sang for the guests over the bowl,
She sat silently by the window.
She searches for it and finds it
She seemed like a stranger to the girl.
She seemed like the right shot
She should meet a black monk
She should stay in the wilderness of the forests.
She shuddered and was silent;
She sighed for another,
She sits quietly and is free.
She sits with a drooping head
She stopped.
She stopped.
She suppressed tears,
She waits for him every day;
She was all stunned and flushed
She was also bored by the ringing laughter,
She was completely comforted:
She was following her wildly,
She was getting naked with a sad noise,
She was preparing a fire
She was sitting at the table
She was trembling and turning pale.
She was unhurried,
She was waiting for misfortune.
She was worried about the signs;
She watched them go
She went to work,
She will not go to meet the winter,
She won't see him.;
She wore a very narrow corset,
She wouldn't hurt me.
She wrote with a lovely finger
She's a darkening eye
She's already learned how to change!
She's coming towards me. How harsh!
She's gone. It's worth it Eugene,
She's got me in the dark of the night
She's in her own family
She's in the abandoned canopy.
She's in the albums of gentle maidens,
She's like with old friends.,
She's old; her mind is getting dull, Tanya;
She's penetrated; she can't
She's ready to talk.
She's sitting there and that's it!..
She's stuffy here, she's a dream
She's talking about him in the dark of the night,
Shining eyes, Eugene
Shiny, windy, lively,
Should we break up amicably?..
Shutters are closed, windows are chalked
Sick and fondling and fun
Sigh and think about yourself:
Sigh for gloomy Russia,
Sighs and appropriates to himself
Silvered; there's a horn
Similar to the English spline,
Since the young Tatiana
Sing God knows who,
Singer Giaur and Juan
Sit down as it is difficult!
Sit under a deserted roof,
Sits down; the game is over:
Sitting, not cleaned, pale,
Slanderers, and evil cowards,
Sleep is running in her bed;
Sleeping peacefully in the shadow of the blessed
Slides and falls; cheerful
Sliding, crawls out the gate.
Smile, flaxen curls,
Smile, virgin peace,
Smitten by a young friend,
Smitten, Onegin shudders
Snoring is a heavy trifle
Snow fell only in January
So as not to forget who I'm singing about
So bees from a delicious hive
So circumspect, so precise,
So close!.. But my fate
So full of piety,
So, God grant them long days!
So he wrote darkly and listlessly
So, her name was Tatiana.
So her thought wanders far away:
So I, careless, sang
So, I wrote in French
So! indifferent oblivion
So indifferent, so brave?
So is arrogant Moscow.
So it is clearly destined by heaven.
So, let's go quietly grandson
So majestic, so smart,
So, my noon has come, and I need to
So, Nanny, it's really nothing.
So our windy tribe
So people (I'm the first to repent)
So she sat down quietly and looked,
So slowly down the slope of the mountains,
So that he doesn't call me
So that the child does not get exhausted,
So that the flutter of her heart would subside,
So that the husband or the light did not guess
So that the lord's berries are secretly
So that the rest of the year
So that the worm is despicable, poisonous
So the bunny in the winter trembles,
So the fallen grain falls into the ground
So the storms of autumn are cold
So the tree has its own leaves
So, to tell you the truth,
So unapproachable for men,
So we were carried away by a dream
So you are inspired by Languages,
So you're married! I didn't know about the wound!
So your faithful friend
Solitude, silence:
Some important general.
Some kind of army pete
Some kind of sad buffoon
Some kind of vulgar madrigal,
Some solemn odes!
Someday it will light us up
Someone else's delight, someone else's sadness,
Someone who is sweet and scary to her,
Something and somehow,
Something wonderful says to her;
Sometimes
Sometimes, cute objects
Sometimes difficult services
Sometimes he seemed more gentle,
Sometimes he will meet you with a bow,
Sometimes he won't notice at all:
Sometimes, in late leisure
Sometimes it 's prudent to quarrel,
Sometimes it is prudent to keep silent,
Sometimes she is instantly carried away:
Sometimes talkative, sometimes mute,
Sometimes, the flattering voice of light
Sometimes the one that is named
Sometimes, the word of the lord's will
Sometimes white-eyed
Sometimes with a short word, then with a cross,
Sorry. And here she is alone.
Sorry, cheerful nature;
Sorry, peaceful places!
Sorry, peaceful valleys,
Sorry, the games are golden!
Sorry, the shelter is secluded!
Sorry. Why would you follow me
Souls are direct nobility,
Souls of inexperienced excitement
Sparkled without silly affectation,
Sparkling in the sun,
Spending the summer in the village,
Spent in inactivity, in the shadows
Spilled by Olga's hand,
Spinning, and, winter friend of the nights,
Spinning in a red hood,
Spoiled by the habit of life,
Spring brings him to life: for the first time
Spring is calling you to the village,
Spring is enlivened by fire.
Spring rain on the grain fields)
Spring, spring! It's time for love!
Sprinkle with cherries,
Stable, kitchen and fence.
Stalls and chairs
Starched brute,
Stars falling on the breg.
Starts an obscene argument.
Steam is spinning, and warmth
Steel wet bits,
Step in a wide arc,
Still a heart flutter
Still captivated the young mind.
Still, having vegetated, the horses are fighting,
Still hissing in the middle of the table.
Still humble, just as deaf
Still in a hurry to talk.
Still sad, why be sad?..
Still the same after many years.
Still transparent, forests
Straight scissors, curves
Straightened his hair with his hand,
Streams of the neighboring valley.
St.-Rest, your pencils;
Stretch out from the outposts of the city.
Stubborn mouths want to!
Success inspired us first;
Such gossip; but secretly
Such incoherent, vulgar nonsense;
Suddenly a thought was born in her mind
Suddenly everything changed,
Suddenly, from behind the door in the long hall
Suddenly he opened up to me!
Suddenly he really got it
Suddenly his fate will be resolved.
Suddenly it dawned on me: the muse is in her
Suddenly it stops. About one name
Suddenly seeing from afar
Suddenly the doors are wide open. Lensky enters,
Suddenly the wind blew, extinguishing
Suddenly, there is a squalid hut between the trees;
Suddenly there's a stomp!.. Her blood froze.
Summers tend to be harsh prose,
Superbly subtle and clever,
Supervision of aunts, mothers
Suppressing yawns with laughter:
Surprised, amazed,
Surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
Surrounded by a sad haze;
Sweetly on the beam of dawn
Tableaux vivants, or sharp words,
Take a break from the past life.
Take a walk, dear ones!
Take also the combat box.
Take it and find it right
Take the keys from her hall;
Taking the young lady under his protection.
Taking your curious gaze,
Tall, gentle, daring?
Tanya asked. Hurry up
Tanya is delivered every day
Tanya is young in the neighborhood,
Tanya sits down by the window.
Tanya's eyes are streaming.
Tanya's favorite, He's a joy
Tatiana ah! And he roars,
Tatiana and Olga; quickly
Tatiana believed in the legends
Tatiana by her charm.
Tatiana, dear Tatiana!
Tatiana did not take it in her hands;
Tatiana does not sleep in the dark
Tatiana flushed and trembled.
Tatiana from head to toe;
Tatiana goes into the forest; the bear follows her;
Tatiana grumbles at the stream;
Tatiana has been in the fashionable cell for a long time
Tatiana in the short table of contents
Tatiana in the silence of the woods
Tatiana is a greedy soul;
Tatiana is afraid of the winter way.
Tatiana is almost alive; Trike,
Tatiana is barely alive.
Tatiana is being touched; but she
Tatiana is expecting a groom;
Tatiana is in a corner and composes
Tatiana is waiting: when is the answer?
Tatiana jumped into the other hall,
Tatiana languished secretly;
Tatiana listened to him without protest.
Tatiana listened with annoyance
Tatiana, looking at the moon
Tatiana looks and does not see,
Tatiana loves without joking
Tatiana lowered her gaze,
Tatiana, on the advice of the nanny
Tatiana on the wide courtyard
Tatiana (Russian soul,
Tatiana said goodbye to the housekeeper
Tatiana saw them off.
Tatiana saw through the window
Tatiana sees with trepidation,
Tatiana silently leaned on,
Tatiana silk belt
Tatiana thanks everyone.
Tatiana tries to run:
Tatiana walked alone for a long time.
Tatiana wants to find it.
Tatiana wants to listen
Tatiana was standing in front of the window,
Tatiana was waiting impatiently,
Tatiana! Who is it for?
Tatiana will sigh, then gasp;
Tatiana with a curious look
Tatiana with a tender look
Tatiana's letter is in front of me;
Tatiana's letter to Onegin
Tatiana's pale beauties,
Tatiana's sweet ideal
Tell me about it, Nanny,
Tell me: how did he return?
Tell me, Prince, don't you know,
Tell me: which one is Tatiana?
Tell me: with your soul
Tempted the younger heart;
Thank you. By you,
Thank you for the pleasure,
That all my zealous nonsense
That all the girlfriends are dirty
That ardent souls are careless
That girl he's
That girl, or is it a dream?..
That he was really touched,
That he's a dangerous weirdo.
That he's smart and very nice.
That I almost went crazy
That I am rich and noble,
That I haven't sinned for a long time.
That I painted my portrait,
That I'll see you in the afternoon
That in the Highest is destined to be the council
That is, he was able to judge that,
That is, with eyes fixed on Olga,
That long bough of hers by the neck
That my uncle is dying in bed
That Nina is a marble beauty
That nonsense is important to important people
That one has no charms,
That one is gnawing at remorse.
That she deceived us;
That she is gifted from heaven
That she is so trusting,
That snake of memories,
That stupidity is windy and evil,
That the ballet has started a new one.
That the guests are coming. Suddenly seeing
That the husband was mutilated in battles,
That the mind, loving space, is cramping,
That the sight of them gives birth to a splinter.
That the wedding is completely coordinated,
That their immortal family
That there are no awards in the world above.
That there are too many conversations
That there is no despicable slander,
That there is no such nonsense,
That they cheated on her every hour,
That they didn't get fashionable rings.
That they've been waiting for her at home for a long time,
That was an unmistakable sign to her,
That was Olenka's first question.
That year, the autumn weather
That's a country house and by the window
That's closer! They also jump into the yard
That's enough, honey, the whole family
That's enough! With a clear soul
That's exactly what my Eugene thought.
That's gone
That's how Eugene preached.
That's how he killed eight years,
That's how the poor moth shines
That's how the shadow dresses the storms
That's how Vechor casually joked.
That's in the fragile snow with a cute foot
That's me. And that's what they were looking for
That's not it, God forbid!
That's on the memory sheets
That's right, an indifferent guest
That's right, except for you alone
That's right the old invalid
That's right, you'll read the vows
That's the way of education, thank God,
That's what a fool I am!
That's what he sees: on the melted snow,
That's what he thought, and he was happy.
That's what the young rake thought,
That's when I'll start writing
That's why I'm writing this,
That's wonderful.
The advice is reasonable and good;
The alley to the lake, the forest,
The anthem of the times does not come to her,
The argument is louder, louder; suddenly Eugene
The attention of the friendship of the beloved,
The aunts blinked at each other
The barking of the mosek, the smacking of the girls,
The bassoon and flute rang out.
The bear said: My godfather is here:
The beauties didn't stay long
The beauties of Olga the young,
The beauty is pleasantly languid!
The bed is covered with carpet,
The bee behind the tribute field
The big loss is not seeing
The blessing of the tribes.
The blush is brighter. Lensky is mine
The boredom in the village is the same,
The boredom of the road is quite:
The bottle popped; the wine
The boys dispersed the dogs,
The breath froze in my mouth,
The breath of the benevolent night
The bride is a vast semicircle,
The bride of the ripe years,
The bridle is an obedient and zealous horse,
The British Muse is a tall tale
The care of youth is love?
The careful traveler also snores
The careless fruit of my amusements,
The cart rushes through potholes.
The cherished monogram Oh yes e.
The chieftain of the card gang,
The child herself, in a crowd of children
The child was harsh, but sweet.
The children ran to Anisya
The choirs are full of people,
The clock is fixed: the poet
The clock is running; she forgot,
The coffin stone is visible there
The colonel sent it himself.
The common people of antiquity,
The common people, the ideal,
The company commander arrived;
The conditions of light overthrowing the burden,
The conversation began to revive;
The conversations stopped for a moment;
The coolness of the gloomy winter,
The coquette judges in cold blood,
The county frenchman Petushkov,
The couple flashes by the couple.
The creation of hell or heaven,
The credulity of an innocent soul.
The crimson ray of dawn is playing;
The cross-country sled is ready.
The crowd buzzes, sitting down at the table.
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
The crowd is pouring into the living room:
The cue was resting on the billiard table,
The cunning lyricist
The current of rural leisure
The custom is despot among people.
The dance of stars disappears,
The dances were already breaking up;
The dashing droshky is being carried away
The dawn rises in the cold darkness;
The day is dear to me, the hour is dear to me:
The day was getting shorter,
The day's ray will flash in the morning
The days counted by fate.
The days raced by; the air was heated
The deadline is also passing.
The death of the old man's uncle.
The deceased was buried.
The deception of an inexperienced soul!
The departure day is long overdue,
The desire of the heart to whisper to her.
The disease of the newest Russians.
The door opened. Olga to her,
The door opens wide for them,
The dream of the other side,
The driver is sitting on a bench
The easier it is for her to like us
The edge of the clothes is ashamed to raise;
The enemies stand with downcast eyes.
The evening samovar hissed,
The evil mouth did not eat
The extinguished ashes will no longer flare up,
The eyes of an attentive girl
The fact that fashion is autocratic
The fate of Lensky is full;
The father of the family is single,
The features of his pencil.
The feeling is wild and funny to us.
The fever of rhymes: he doubled it
The Finnish singer is young!
The fire of night lamps;
The fire of unexpected epigrams.
The fire on the altar has gone out!..
The fire went out; barely with ashes
The fireplace is barely breathing. Smoke from pipes
The first dream of young delights,
The first snow is flickering, curling,
The flashing of dresses and speeches,
The forerunner of morning labors,
The forest is before them; the pines are motionless
The four mortal stages.
The fourth year of the patient in consumption,
The fragrant tea was already running,
The frames were shaking and rattling;
The fruits of the fullness of the heart,
The future ignoramus will indicate
The gang of brownies was confused;
The general who entered with her.
The gentle pages of the novel
The ghost is a vain seeker,
The Ghost of Irrevocable Days:
The Girl was taken to the wedding.
The girls are whispering in the corner;
The girls in Tatiana's rooms
The girls were quieter
The glow goes out. There's a valley there
The goddess is going to a masquerade.
The goddess of secrets and gentle sighs.
The golden autumn has come.
The golden coal is tinged;
The goose is heavy on red paws,
The great charm of conversation.
The green tables are open:
The habits of the dear old;
The hammer rattles on the ramrod.
The happiness of the young years has disappeared,
The head of the Chaldean sages,
The head of the rakes, the tribune of the tavern,
The hearts of the record coquettes!
The heir of all his relatives.
The Heirs are an angry chorus
The herds are noisy, and the nightingale
The hermit is idle and sad,
The hero of our novel!
The heroes of our conversation:
The higher tone is rather boring;
The home circle is dearer to me,
The horn and the song are bold
The hostess shouts:
The hour is coming.;
The humble are not without difficulty,
The Humble Sinner, Dmitry Larin,
The husband comes. He interrupts
The Hussar Pykhtin was staying with us;
The idea of rural witticism!)
The incessant whisper of Nereida,
The initial beauties:
The inscription says to the alien:
The instant harvest of a generation,
The instant tenderness of the eyes
The ladies moved closer to her;
The ladies sat down by the fireplace;
The lady was approaching the hostess,
The language of girlish dreams
The language of Petrarch and love.
The Larin family fell silent.
The Larins produced
The late Lensky, our neighbor.
The lazy East is resting,
The legislator's room?
The legs of lovely ladies are flying;
The less we love a woman,
The letter is ready, folded
The letter trembles in her hand;
The letter where the heart speaks,
The life of both of us was tormenting;
The life-giving voice has died,
The light and the noisy ball are forgotten,
The light shirt came down
The longing of a troubled soul?
The longing of love drives Tatiana away,
The Lord's slave and foreman,
The lords of the neighboring villages
The loss of life is the best color.
The love of an innocent virgin breathes.
The mad soul of a poet
The magic of a secret story!
The magnificent, regal Neva.
The maiden's mirror is lying.
The manor house is secluded,
The master's tea is too sweet,
The matchmaker went for two weeks
The Mazurka was heard. It happened,
The melodies are sonorous.
The melody of the Torquat octaves!
The men bowed lower,
The merchant gets up, the peddler goes,
The mind and passion to win,
The mind of cold observations
The minds of my hermits.
The minx has already frozen his finger:
The moon has disappeared behind the mountain,
The moon in the silver light,
The moon is in the air blue.
The moon, the heavenly lamp,
The morning snow crunches under it.
The mouth is chewing. From all sides
The murderer of his brother;
The murderer of the young poet?
The murmur of a quiet stream;
The muse began to appear to me.
The music is too tired to rattle;
The music will be regimental!
The mysterious canopy of forests
The name of the fervent players
The neighbor decided.
The neighbor is called to the samovar,
The neighbor sniffs in front of the neighbor;
The neighbor's monument is humble,
The neighbors are whispering among themselves:
The neighbors gathered in carts,
The new landowner rode in
The newest Regulus, the god of honor,
The night has many lovely stars,
The night is frosty, the whole sky is clear;
The night shadows are already thinning
The night sky over the Neva
The oblivion of life in the storms of light,
The old duelist intervened;
The old ladies hugged each other crying,
The old ladies smiled at her;
The old lady loved it very much
The old lady to her:
The old man inquires.
The old man, joking in the old way:
The old woman said with a grunt.
The one after the first greeting,
The one from which he keeps
The one she sighs for
The one who insulted you behind the bottle,
The one whose appearance vaguely reminded
The opening is big soon
The ordinary one was waiting for fate.
The other attracted her attention,
The other is slowly circling,
The other managed her suffering
The other one has come: everything is not as it is not.
The other one!.. No, no one in the world
The other one with a rooster's head,
The other smiled slyly,
The overnight stay is taken away from the entrance hall
The owner is full, but up to now
The owner of the poor men;
The parquet cracked under his heel,
The passions of others are rebellious,
The peasants are all rich there,
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
The pen is not in fashion these days.
The pharaoh is throwing his motley sword.
The pink wafer is drying
The pipe smoke rises in a column of blue,
The pistols have already flashed,
The pledge is worthier than you,
The ploughman likes to rest there,
The poet, blessed with insensibility,
The poet died, but his
The poet expressed himself;
The poet is modest, though great,
The poet is waiting for an answer at home;
The poet is waiting for the end of the Mazurka
The poet's memory flashed by
The poet's passionate conversation,
The poor thing is going to faint;
The Prince is coming
The Prince looks at Onegin.
The Princess is in front of him, alone,
The Princess looks at him
The Princess stretched out on the sofa.
The purpose of our life is for him
The radiance of pink snow,
The ray of the luminaries of the night shines;
(The reader is waiting for the rhyme of the rose;
The reins are fluffy blowing up,
The renegade of stormy pleasures,
The ride is pleasant and easy.
The rings come out in succession;
The rite of famous treats:
The river shines, it is clothed with ice.
The Russian is treated with a hammer
The sad dawn of a stormy life!..
The sad moon is trembling
The same friend Monsieur Finmouche,
The same lies Lyubov Petrovna,
The same tulle cap;
The schemes of a despicable cunning
The second Chadaev, my Evgeny,
The second, the third letter
The sensible husband left soon after
The sentries called to each other,
The servants have come running to the gate
The shark of the old Selina
The sheets that died in the fall,
The shelter of thoughtful dryads.
The shepherd is still singing
The shepherd wakes up the villager.
The shepherd, weaving his mottled lapot,
The shutters are open;
The singer is forced to sit down;
The singer of Feasts and languid sadness,
The skies are shining blue.
The sky was breathing in autumn,
The slave is cunning from the shackles
The sleepy well was moved,
The slow appearance of guests
The slow Summer will swallow you up,
The smile of the mouth, the movement of the eyes
The snow is loose up to her knees;
The song of the girls
The sorceress winter is coming.
The soul is a tragedy in the corner,
The soul is in it for a long time involuntarily
The soul of a trusting confession,
The soul was ignited in him;
The soul was waiting for someone,
The souls have not changed in him,
The spring of honor, our idol!
The spring of my days rushed by
The spurs of the cavalry are strumming;
The stanza composed by me;
The stomach
The storm blew, the color is beautiful
The subject is worthy: nothing
The subject of both thoughts and pen,
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
The subject of my innocent poems,
The subject of noisy judgments,
The subject of songs and love,
The sun is already rolling high,
The sun is playing; it's melting dirty
The sun shone less often,
The table is set in front of the fireplace,
The theater is already full; the boxes are shining;
The theater is an evil legislator,
The thirst for food is fatal;
The tombstone reads:
The torment of fashionable rhymers,
The traditions of the Russian family,
The twilight is thinning; but she
The unknown in the grass is deaf
The vagaries of the big world!
The valleys dry up and are full of color;
The vaunted grandfather's time:
The venerable castle was built,
The village of Lensky, lives
The village where Eugene was bored,
The wagon train is ordinary, three caravans
The wagons are loaded with a mountain,
The waltz is spinning, a noisy whirlwind;
The watch of the distant vault of heaven,
The white stone of Moscow
The whole house is full; whole families
The whole story of your fate.
The Widows of Clicquot or Moet
The windy youth is guessing,
The winter road is smooth.
The words and gaze of these witches are
The world will forget me; but you
The wrong one is hooking the ice,
The young ladies are crowding towards Tatiana;
The young man lies motionless,
The young viewer is amazed
The Younger Graces of Moscow
The younger maiden will replace me more than once
The younger two-horned face of the moon
The younger virgo is with him himself-a friend;
The youth of the summer would have passed:
Their branches are all burdened
Their comedies are a noisy swarm,
Their conversation is reasonable
Their daughters hug Tanya.
Their hand was not stained,
Their household will hear them,
Their natural virtues,
Their poetic fire
Their rooms are locked,
Their unexpected arrival
Their wilfulness or impulses
Then a villainous rhyme came up.
Then at least you had pity,
Then he puts her on a chair,
Then he saw clearly,
Then he sees the forgotten enemies,
Then he started talking again
Then I drank my coffee,
Then I started reading books.
Then I took care of the household,
Then I tore off my heart;
Then, in return for babbling,
Then in the desert,
Then in them he paints rural views,
Then know: the barb of your abuse,
Then Monseur changed it.
Then, obeying nature,
Then she turned to her husband
Then she will drop the handkerchief;
Then the camp will develop, then it will develop
Then the novel is in the old way
Then they bring a guitar:
Then they induced sleep;
Then they liked it; then
Then to the stage
Then with a question hook.
There are a lot of contradictions,
There are a lot of neighbors around;
There are bedbugs and fleas at the stations
There are damask wallpapers in the living room,
There are different chains on all of them;
There are foxes everywhere,
There are high chambers everywhere,
There are involuntary tribute lakes
There are light patterns on the glasses,
There are many beauties in Moscow.
There are many sad adventures.
There are millions of bipedal creatures
There are new generation of beauties,
There are no inns. In a cold hut
There are no others, but those are far away,
There are songs, a round dance;
There are three bottles on loan to drain.
There are two hearts about him, maybe,
There are two verses from the Aeneid.
There Didlo was crowned with glory,
There he brought out a sharp Shakhovskoy
There is a carla with a ponytail, but here
There is a crush in the hall, an alarm;
There is a dressing gown and a cap on the cotton wool.
There is a friend of innocent pleasures
There is a greedy regiment of lenders.
There is a hall on the mirrored parquet floor,
There is a long row of dinners alone,
There is a meeting of new faces in the living room,
There is a passionate heat in her; she is stuffy, sick;
There is a place: to the left of the village,
There is a roar of music, a sparkle of candles,
There is a scream and the clink of a glass outside the door,
There is a single arbitrariness of passions,
There is a tavern at each station.
There is already snow from the surrounding mountains
There is also a dream flying over him.
There is an affectionate meeting everywhere,
There is an explanation for the sad mystery.
There is an impatient splashing in the neighborhood,
There is another dictator in the doorway.
There is great zeal for the guests,
There is jumping and noise on the stage;
There is no ancient hunting in Peru
There is no answer. He's a messenger again:
There is no answer. In one assembly
There is no conscience in that, there is no sense in that;
There is no doubt: alas! Evgeniy
There is no hope! He's leaving,
There is no joy for her anywhere, in anything,
There is no need; the law of fate is right.
There is no return to dreams and years;
There is no road; bushes, rapids
There is no trace of night melancholy,
There is noise and crowding all around;
There is not a drop of coquetry in her
There is not a single soul in the hallway.
There is not much elegant here.
There is one shining among the wives and maidens.
There is only a trace of anger on this face
There is only one weapon for us;
There is snow on the streets.
There our Katenin resurrected
There seem to be smart people here
There, there under the wings
There used to be an early breeze
There was a commotion, a farewell cry:
There was a languid world of his brow.
There was a lovely corner;
There was a messenger who spoke
There was a science of tender passion,
There was also a groom at that time
There was an unbearable scream
There was, however, the color of the capital,
There was no bear; she was in the hall;
There was Prolasov, who deserved
There was very little need for that,
There were elderly ladies here
There were Russian pancakes;
There were several girls here,
There will be a ball, there will be a children's party.
There would be a faithful spouse
There's a nightingale, a lover of spring,
There's a thick one by the stream in the shade
There's a whole line of liqueurs in the other,
There's a witch with a goatee here,
There's an icy corpse on the sleigh;
There's boredom, there's deception or nonsense;
There's crowding, excitement, heat,
There's dinner, it's time to sleep there,
There's not a speck of ink anywhere.
There's nothing to do, friends.
These are my friends, my friends!
They appeared; they were wasted
They are above the chessboard,
They are both being updated and maturing
They are carrying household belongings,
They are each other in silence
They are focused on them more vividly.
They are harnessed to the boyar wagon,
They are in a hurry to appear, to thunder,
They are in the garden, hand in hand,
They are not called by his horn;
They are not so different from each other.
They are not worth any passion,
They are rowing silver with a shovel;
They are the most expensive of the briefest
They barely took up the saucers,
They bring notes to him.
They, by stern command
They call two friends and put them in jail.
They came to my tongue,
They came together, and no one
They captivated her heart more.
They carried dishes according to rank.
They carry jam on saucers,
They did not know needles; leaning on an embroidery frame,
They didn 't stop worrying
They didn't think about us.
They disturb my heart.
They disturb the heart sometimes:
They disturb the sleep of my soul.
They disturb the sleep of the adolescent,
They don't give you a minute to fall asleep;
They don't see him, not a word with him;
They drove for seven days.
They escaped in muddy streams
They find her strange,
They flash in my eyes like a fence.
They flowed quietly. The beetle was buzzing.
They fly off the coast.
They go to the table hand in hand.
They got together. Wave and Stone,
They had already decided.
They have a fat carnival
They have arrived now.
They have not been new to us for a long time.
They have not yet been accomplished for the light,
They have to go to the mill
They haven't stopped stomping yet,
They kept it in a peaceful life
They laugh, argue and squeak.
They lay down on chairs in the dining room,
They look at Tanya primly
They loved round swings,
They make friends with her, lead her to themselves,
They merged into one Onegin.
They needed kvass like air,
They prepare death in cold blood
They pressed deep into the soul.
They prevailed. She has two words
They put a waxed one on the table
They put him right in front of Tanya,
They put on a single image,
They replaced everything for her;
They rise, mature and fall;
They rushed over. He tells the servant to
They sat down, and the venerable cart,
They scold the gentlemen and beat them in the palm of their hands
They send him to the waters in unison.
They shed tears three times;
They should always be honored;
They sing, and, with carelessness
They sit deep in thought,
They slander even boring;
They sleep on fur coats at the entrance;
They sound and flow. He reads them
They speak unfavorably.
They stop involuntarily
They tenderly demand one.
They told me to call, and there is no reason
They turn white: that's really on Tverskaya
They unwound my braid crying
They want to drip; they're ready
They were able to attract her again
They were boring each other.;
They were changing places;
They were full of flowers and bloomed before him
They were guessing about their young ladies
They were silent for two minutes,
They whisper to her:
They will argue about the grave canopy;
They will gladly accept us.
They will not touch my heart,
They will produce it in my chest;
They will refuse
They're flying home at full speed.
They're laughing. The guests enter.
They're sitting. The words won't come
Thinking, my soul,
Thirst asks for more glasses
This angel, this arrogant demon,
This Cleopatra of the Neva;
This Grandison was a nice dandy,
This Hellespont swam,
This is a profound creation
This is how nature created us,
This is how our century is being corrected!
This is Onegin's holy life;
This is the master's office;
This is the village custom;
This song is a pitiful tune;
This unpleasant tete-a-tete;
This verse was printed;
Those were secret legends
Those who felt it are worried
Those who have lived and thought cannot
Thoughtfulness, her friend
Thoughts will not flare up for a whole day,
Threats, rumors, predictions,
Three houses are calling for the evening:
Three pairs of slender female legs.
Through a tight row of aristocrats,
Through tears without seeing anything,
Through the cups with a dark stream
Through the fingers of timid students:
Thunderstorms of the midnight Watches;
Tighten up the song,
Tightened, mute and motionless,
Time passes; meanwhile
Tired look; slipped out
To a secluded corner,
To a voice known by children:
To achieve a secret date
To admit it: I would have borrowed it!
To admit: the taste is very little
To amuse the half - dead,
To amuse the imagination
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
To answer sharply and stupidly,
To appear gloomy, to languish,
To appear proud and obedient,
To appropriate the mind of someone else;
To be known as a fake weirdo,
To break the vessel of the slanderer;
To break up now as a friend.
To breathe in the frosty dust
To burn with reason every hour
To call Moina (in order to,
To catch a moment of tenderness,
To catch with loving eyes,
To clean from deviations.
To complete the humble way of life!
To disbelieve, to make believe,
To disturb with my lyre,
To disturb you, my dear:
To establish a new order.
To freeze in agony before you,
To get better in business and in style,
To glorify your sad lot,
To go to Moscow in winter.
To go without sharing with her
To govern autocratically,
To harbor hope, to be jealous,
To harden, to harden,
To have a two-morning flower
To have Faith every morning
To her porch, the glass vestibule
To her shoulder; suddenly Olga enters,
To her village, where she,
To him with a guilty head.
To his father, not to his mother;
To His momentary bliss;
To his sarcastic argument,
To his village at the same time
To his wife and brings her
To impress with your arrival;
To lick Phaedra, Cleopatra,
To listen to you for a long time, to understand
To look at life as a rite of passage,
To look at you with a cheerful look!..
To love, to respect mentally
To make the burning go away.
To meet the poor singer
To Moscow, to the bride fair!
To my family, and finally
To my famous portrait
To my infant dreams
To my performance:
To myself, to the mysterious tree;
To name; but from head to toe
To Onegin. Well, business, business.
To our round dance,
To pale and fade away is bliss!
To present to the grandparents
To punish me with contempt.
To put to sleep with love flattery,
To read books here alone.
To remain silent in an important dispute
To ride on horseback in the harsh steppe?
To see foreign countries;
To see Olga before the fight,
To see this Phyllida for me,
To see you in our village,
To shed a tear over an early urn
To shine, captivate and fly away.
To sighs, boredom and deception
To sit with the patient day and night,
To sort out the epigraphs,
To subdue the excitement in the blood;
To take care of me like a faithful friend,
To take care of the older sister.
To talk about Juvenal,
To Tatiana Lensky; Harlikov,
To the ambassador of such an assignment
To the ancestress Eva:
To the beginning of a young life.
To the court of the discerning light
To the deceased from all sides
To the decency of the law of light,
To the depths of his soul
To the lodges of unknown ladies;
To the magic tunes
To the mocking reader
To the neighbor and tell him to,
To the noise of brilliant vanities
To the noise of feasts and riotous disputes,
To the old woman with grief she is.
To the Princess with a weak hand
To the river running under the mountain;
To the river through the lime forest.
To the song of the old days:
To the sunken meadows.
To the village, to the poor villagers,
To touch sweet feet with your lips!
To visit a deserted castle,
To walk? The village of that time
To want to hug your knees
To warn the dawn sunrise,
To where he appeared to her.
To which we dedicated
To whom, for their sins,
To whom I sing, that's good
To whom, in a crowd of jealous virgins,
To whom, my dear?
To whom the heart was dedicated,
To your desperate appeal?
To your flowers, to your novels
Today, dear friends,
Tolstoy with a miraculous brush
Tortured by the verse for a long time,
Touch everything lightly,
Tragi-nervous phenomena,
Transforming yourself into a horse;
Treads carefully on the ice,
Treason by the fatal news,
Trees in winter silver,
Trembling, unable to find words,
Tribes of the past treaties,
Trickles writhed beneath them
Trike brought a verse to Tatiana
Trike stands up; the assembly is in front of him
Trike, the shrewd poet,
Trotting along somehow;
Trumpeting about himself everywhere
Tsimlyanskoe is already being carried;
Turning around, without unnecessary words
Turning away from the gun.
Turning to her with a piece of paper in his hand,
Twice a year they talked;
Twisting, he runs through a green meadow
Two bullets
Two closets, a table, a down sofa,
Two days seemed new to him
Two friends came here,
Two hearts, a torch and flowers;
Two legs Sad, cold,
Two minutes later, then
Two of them are sitting in the dark;
Two perches, glued together by an ice floe,
Two pine trees have grown together by their roots;
U! How is it surrounded now
Ulan, his slave share,
Ulan is loved by her soul
Ulan knew how to captivate her,
Unbearable (agree on that)
Under a hat with a cloudy brow,
Under it (as it starts to drip
Under the canopy of cherry trees and acacias
Under the inspiring moon.
Under the long tablecloth of the tables,
Under the robe of storms, arguing with the waves,
Under the silk curtain
Under the sky of my Africa,
Under the sky of Schiller and Goethe
Under the stone, this one tastes peace.
Unfortunately, Larina was dragging,
(Unfortunately, too salty);
Unhappy jealousy of torment,
Unnoticed by anyone,
Unrelated dreams,
Until Morpheus arrives,
Until now, ladies' love
Until recently, I lived in winter
Until the age of twenty-six,
Unwittingly bothers the eye
Updates the path on the firewood;
Used to be virginally sad,
Vice has always been punished,
Vice is amiable in the novel too,
Villages flashed by; here and there
Vladimir closes the book,
Vladimir has no power
Vladimir immediately wrote
Vladimir Lensky lies here,
Vladimir Lensky visited
Vladimir replied dryly
Vladimir said. And let's go
Vladimir sweet captivity
Vladimir would write odes,
Vyazemsky somehow got hooked on her
Wait, I'll introduce you.
Waiting for us behind the coffin.
Walking in the middle of the evening darkness,
Walking in the morning;
Walking, reading, deep sleep,
Walking through a snow glade,
Walking, walking. And suddenly in front of him
Wandering over my lake,
Warm, dark old days,
Warm up at his place a little!
Warmed by a virgin fire.
Warmed by inspiration from God,
Was born for this life with his heart.
Was he embarrassed, the singer is sad,
Was he in the midst
Wash your face, shoulders and chest:
Wasn't that how I was in the old days
We all learned a little bit
We are busy, we judge everything,
We are happy to accept for business,
We are the fading of our years,
We both knew the passion game;
We bring the confused duma closer
We can argue, but I'm silent:
We can't do magic with Tatiana.
We did not pass without science,
We have entered into an important agreement,
We have to caress them,
We haven't heard about love;
We honor everyone with zeros,
We kept many pages
We like to listen sometimes
We remember the bitter loss,
We rode together every day
We slide along the lacquer boards.
We slowly languish in desire,
We wandered around the world. Congratulations
We were given youth,
We were silently reveling!
We will also be ousted from the world!
We will change immensely:
We will multiply the price of love,
We will revive it with Jealous fire;
We will torment the heart, and then
We will wilfully sanctify.
We'd better hurry to the ball,
We'll break up for this, I'm sorry!
We'll show Tanya tomorrow.
We're all looking at the Napoleons.;
Weaning our hearts from praise,
Wearing a wide bolivar,
Wearing glasses and a red wig.
Weeping bitterly,
Well, a lot of good stuff.
Well, exactly the same as it was.
Well, he says, you tell me,
Well? I found a secret charm
Well, if your gun
Well, Mother? What happened?
Well, my poor style
Well, what about it?
Well, what about the neighbors? What is Tatiana?
Well? You're going: it's a pity.
Went and what? The bear is after her!
Were you in love then?
Wet nurses cry and cry of children.
What a bitter contempt
What a joy: there will be a ball!
What a languid excitement
What a low cunning
What a secret tom my daughter
What a soul! Someday
What a storm of sensations
What a thought, a remark
What about him? Is it imitation,
What about my Onegin? Half asleep
What am I talking about in my stanzas
What are our best wishes,
What are our fresh dreams
What are the chosen of fate,
What are we being caressed by the yard for?
What brings you here? What a little thing!
What could be worse in the world
What did he know more firmly than all the sciences,
What do I need in your mind?
What do I want? for what purpose
(What do we call romanticism,
What do you want, ask
What do you want more? The light has decided,
What does he hear? She could
What does my fate promise me?
What does the coming day have in store for me?
What, drearily languishing,
What else can I say?
What feeling will take over,
What has everyone been sure of for a long time,
(What have I been jokingly saying up to now)?
What have I found in your heart?
What? Invitations? Really,
What is above a timid, gentle love
What is given to you does not attract
What is her dream now?
What is it about, Tanya? I used to,
What is the answer? one severity.
What kind of malicious fun,
What kind of nets I prepared for them!
(What should we praise in it).
What, spleen or suffering arrogance
What stirred in the depths
What stupid places!
What to do! I repeat again:
What was the consequence of the date?
What was the difference for him
What will he present to us so far?
What will it be now? Melmotte,
What's in them? I'm glad to give it back now
What's tomorrow Lensky and Evgeny
What's waiting for him there?
What's wrong with him? What a strange dream he's in!
What's your name? He's watching
Whatever he notices or hears
When a simple product has.
When and where, in what desert,
When churches and bell towers,
When did the nanny collect
When everyone came out on the porch,
When he is deaf and silent
When he saw it.
When I found out among the guests
When I helped the poor
When I wanted to destroy
When I was seriously ill,
When in the garden, in the alley of us
When in the pale sky
When is a shooting star
When is the rebellious youth
When it comes to Eugenia
When it happened somewhere
When it is transparent and light
When my head hurt;
When she came to her senses, Tatiana looked:
When she's riding headlong she
When the brilliant lady
When the devil will take you!
When the flame of passion is extinguished,
When the good enlightenment
When the Mazurka thunder thundered,
When there is a severe melancholy
When there was one sitting in the corner,
When visiting with him, he says three words,
When we are motionless, on the ground
When wearing a man's outfit,
When will I start running free?
When will we run to the banner
When with such simplicity,
When would I be a father, a spouse
When would I have had hope
When would it be a family picture
When would life be a domestic circle
When would she have known,
When would Tatiana have known,
When would you know how terrible it is
Where are the cross and the shadow of the branches today
Where are the stormy desires of love,
Where are the teachings they tell us,
Where are the tear stains?.. They are not there, they are not there!
Where are the two neighbors gathered
Where are you? Come: your rights
Where are you crushing the spring flowers?
Where can I find an eclogue!
Where did the inspiration pet live,
Where did you have fun in winter;
Where do they scold me like that nowadays,
Where does your fast running go on it
Where everyone is breathing freely,
Where everything is safe, everything is free,
Where he waves a tinsel mantle
Where he wintered like a groundhog,
Where he's going in the evening.
Where I buried my heart.
Where I suffered, where I loved,
Where is it long in the bosom of silence
Where is the bloody shadow
Where is the boring husband, knowing her value
Where is the eternal rhyme to her youth?
Where is the noble aspiration
Where is the student exemplary
Where is the village old-timer
Where is this cloudy weirdo,
Where maybe you were born
Where my days flowed in the wilderness,
Where our hero lived recently.
Where sad he left a mark.
Where should I read them?
Where Tatiana met him.
Where Terpsichore is the only one
Where Thalia is quietly napping
Where the bright stream flows,
Where there are two more in uniform
Where to! and again, the matter is apart.
Where to go headlong in the Yamskaya carriage
Where, where have you gone,
Where, where is the confusion, compassion?
Where, why am I striving?
Where will my prankster go?
Which he is alone with,
Which he silently agreed to.
Which I am now unaccustomed to.
Which I sometimes get late
Which in days gone by
Which is kind of funny these days.
Which is not sorry for anything,
Which is very nice.
Which makes us sleepy,
(Which may be the same thing)
Which means exactly relatives.
Which Nazon sang,
Which reflected the century
Which took the whole day
(Which was also the case in previous years,
Which were not and are not
Which would be your friend with a smile,
While the star was still rolling,
While the vigilant breget
Whiny women and doctors.
Whispered again
Whispered: Isn't it true? I'm happy.
Whitewashed. There is no hostess.
Who are all the movements, all the words
Who are you, my guardian angel,
Who cares about our vice?
Who cares about us?
Who cooled love by separation,
Who did you see in your dream?
Who did your verse idolize?
Who died early by the death of the brave,
Who, for better or for worse,
Who has been talked about for a century:
Who has fame, money and ranks
Who has no rebirth?
Who has not indulged in strange dreams,
Who hasn't read her novel
Who, having calmed down a cold mind,
Who inspired her with tender nonsense,
Who inspired her with this tenderness too,
Who is gradually getting cold in life
Who is he? Is it really Eugene?
Who is not bored with hypocrisy,
Who is not spreading slander about us?
Who is the old Tanya, poor Tanya
Who is with his heart and mind
Who is your lyre sighing for?
Who loves more than you,
Who measures all deeds, all speeches
Who proudly challenged you to battle,
Who reads his dreams
Who should I love? Who should I believe?
Who was a dandy or a grabber at the age of twenty,
Who was no stranger to the secular rabble,
Who was released at fifty
Who will be there? my own family.
Who will he start with? Anyway:
Who will never get bored?
Who won't cheat on us alone?
Who won't get tired of threats,
Who would dare to look for a gentle girl
Who would have thought? How long ago!
Who's there in the crimson beret
Whoever you are, oh my reader,
Whose benevolent hand
Whose gaze, stirring inspiration,
Whose head is not spinning,
Whose heart has been cooled by experience
Why are you turning pale again?
Why did he end up a sufferer
Why did you visit us?
Why do you have me in mind?
Why is it fruitless to argue with the age?
Why is it so unfavorable
Wild, sad, silent,
Will flash and not: it is known,
Will he go home, and at home
Will he rise, immediately the conversation
Will I depict the faithful in the picture
Will I fall, pierced by an arrow,
Will I go forward, will I go back?..
Will I hear your choirs again?
Will I open my soul to you?
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
Will I see you?.. And the stream came down
Will the hour of my freedom come?
Will you come, virgin of beauty,
Winter has already been resolved;
Winter!.. The peasant, triumphant,
Winters are a resplendent carpet.
With a clouded moon,
With a firm, quiet, even gait
With a French book in his hands.
With a kerchief on his head, gray-haired,
With a languid head bowing;
With a light smile on his lips.
With a living mind and will,
With a pen and paints slightly;
With a sad thought in his eyes,
With a seminarian in a yellow chalet
With a sensitive soul, with a mind
With a silk pattern, she
With a soul full of regrets,
With a soul straight from Gottingen,
With a stocking in his hand, a gray-haired Kalmyk.
With an inexplicable beauty
With an involuntary sigh of regret:
With an obedient doll child
With children of all ages, counting
With dreams, the heart of the old days,
With fire and sighs and praises
With fire in downcast eyes,
With hands clasped in a cross.
With her cold beauty
With her my lips will find
With his caring posture,
With his embittered mind,
With his heavy half.
With his hungry wolf
With his immoral soul,
With his portly wife
With in hand!
With inexplicable joy
With its groves, meadows
With lunch, tea
With me, it used to be on Sunday,
With my wayward muse
With Onegin, he recalls
With sad Tanya, our friend;
With the betrayal of my youth
With the brilliant Nina Voronskaya,
With the embellishment of light slander.
With the family of Panfil Harlikov
With the glory of red heels
With the happy power of dreaming
With the hero of my novel
With the keys of the old Kremlin:
With the scholarly air of a connoisseur
With the young Venetian,
With this note to O
With us and in our names
With what heavenly pride
With what heavy emotion
With what lively charm
With your loquacious lyre;
Withered at the dawn,
Withered still half-open.
Withered! Where is the hot excitement,
Within the limits of eternity deaf
Without a brazen look for everyone,
Without a grammatical error
Without an inconspicuous trace
Without any malice and tricks,
Without ceasing to advance,
Without compulsion in conversation
Without elegiac ideas
Without eternal truths, without pedantry,
Without imitative ideas
Without preface, this is the hour
Without pretensions to success,
Without surprise, without anger
Without taking a step away!
Without them, Onegin is finished.
Without these little antics,
Women and coachmen are cursing.
Women flash past the booth,
Women's leprosy swearing,
Words: forest, storm, witch, spruce,
Words of longing love,
Worthy of old monkeys
Would you like a tempting honor?
Would you really know life,
Write odes, gentlemen,
Writing poems about other things,
Yawned with friends and with his wife,
Yawning, he took up the pen,
Yawning, listen to the prayer service,
Yawns are cold stuff
Yeah! It's been a long time since you've been in the world.
Yes, after a boring lunch
Yes and no.
Yes droshky a distant knock
Yes, for the humble cemetery,
Yes, glasses are ringing.
Yes, however, to my friend
Yes, I remember, I remember. Where is he?
Yes, I remembered, though not without sin,
Yes, in a salted bottle,
Yes, it was obvious that the mail was delayed.
Yes, Marmontel's third volume.
Yes, maybe the fear of secrecy,
Yes, move the table; I'll go to bed soon;
Yes, Olga did not read them.
Yes, Olga has already given her word
Yes, she wanders through the woods alone.
Yes, she was stupid.
Yes, Tatiana's name day
Yes, thank God, you're healthy!
Yes, the customs of our antiquity.
Yes, the one who is sad
Yes, there are two or three more novels with him,
Yes, they took me to church with a stump.
Yes, you're ready, beautiful!
Yesterday to remind her;
You appeared to me in my dreams
You are a pure, fiery soul,
You are also, mothers, stricter
You are haunted by dreams:
You are my guardian to the grave
You call the dark bliss,
You came in a little bit, I found out in a moment,
You can be a good person
You can't even show your nose at them.
You, decorated nimbly
You did a noble thing.,
You didn't leave any traces:
You didn't like me Well now
You don't have time to imagine
You don't have to come to the call.
You drink the magic poison of desires,
You guessed it; that's right:
You have paid tribute to madness.
You have seen similar ladies.
You haven't forgotten until now,
You holy poetry dreams!
You imagine everywhere
You know, I'm not clear
You, Levshin's school chicks,
You must connect with him,
You need to explain yourself frankly.
You retain your rights.
You see, the case of the letter
You shifted the passionate virgin
You spoke to me in silence,
You, the ghost of an unearthly life,
You, the idol of thirty centuries!
You, the indifferent lucky ones,
You, the serpent constantly calls you
You village Priams,
You were friends with him.:
You were right in front of me:
You will agree, my reader,
You will find the whole of Russia
You will learn the bliss of life,
You will love again: but
You will perish, my dear; but first
You will start crying: your tears
You won't find it in you, the light is empty.
You won't leave me.
You would never know,
You'll have to resurrect it from everywhere:
You're bigger somehow. No, it's the same.
You're in a blaze of hope.
You're in the hands of a fashionable tyrant
You're invited to them next week.
You're not listening to me.
You're not sick at all:
You're right, and you'll point us out correctly
You're the one I've been drunk on!
Your creations? They say,
Your face is like the color of poppies.
Your gun then Eugene,
Your insolence, your vest
Your lucky rights,
Your own style in an important mood,
Your pensive singing?
Your perfections are in vain:
Your proud look will portray!
Your secret heat, your dreams,
Your soul is all your perfection,
Your tempter is fatal.
Your trusting conscience
Your voice sounded in my soul
Your wonderful look tormented me,
Zaretsky,
Zaretsky bit his lip.
Zaretsky carefully puts
Zaretsky condemned the millstone.
Zaretsky, once a brawler,
Zaretsky stood up without explanation;
Zaretsky thirty-two steps
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
With this note to O
Neither Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneca,
Under the sky of my Africa,
The incessant whisper of Nereida,
How often is it on the shores of Taurida
And babysitter the girl with a plea
He couldn't get rid of the chorea,
She drove me to listen to the noise of the sea,
Along the free crossroads of the sea
Olga will be ordered to make tea,
With lunch, tea
And Dunya pours tea;
He was lying on a crumpled sofa
The Princess stretched out on the sofa.
Two closets, a table, a down sofa,
And strange behavior with Olga
Onegin went with Olga;
That is, with eyes fixed on Olga,
And he thinks: Has something happened to Olga?
Before my dear Olga,
He's busy with his Olga.
A little boy, captured by Olga,
When it comes to Eugenia
You will find the whole of Russia
Sigh for gloomy Russia,
It was, friends, Martin Zadeka,
He thought to embarrass Olenka,
I also saved the Mazurka
The poet is waiting for the end of the Mazurka
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
And he remembered Tatiana Mila
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
I'm out of here, immersed in the duma,
Near Olga, he plunged into the duma,
And boldly instead of bee Nna
Does not reflect the face of Diana,
About an early meeting; and Tatiana
Is that really the same Tatiana,
And here is one, one Tatiana!
Since the young Tatiana
We can't do magic with Tatiana.
Trike brought a verse to Tatiana
Onegin's letter to Tatiana
Tatiana, dear Tatiana!
My dear Tatiana
My dear Tatiana!
And finally for Tatiana
So, her name was Tatiana.
Her sister's name was Tatiana
The young ladies are crowding towards Tatiana;
Tell me: which one is Tatiana?
Well, what about the neighbors? What is Tatiana?
He rushed to her, to his Tatiana
And silent, like Svetlana,
And I'm thinking about Svetlana
At the aunt of Princess Elena
Tragi-nervous phenomena,
Corset, album, Princess Alina,
But in the old days, Princess Alina,
The shark of the old Selina
I love her, my friend Elvina,
Just like in the Vandik's Madonna:
Oh, she's a gray-haired Filipyevna
The same lies Lyubov Petrovna,
Everything is white Lukerya Lvovna,
And tears and rhymes et cetera?..
Pots, basins et cetera,
To lick Phaedra, Cleopatra,
He drew it with a mourning taffeta.
Chest lifted, lanita
To the ancestress Eva:
This Cleopatra of the Neva;
Perhaps on the banks of the Neva
The night sky over the Neva
The magnificent, regal Neva.
Buyanov drove away to Pustyakova,
I shared it with the younger Semenova;
With the brilliant Nina Voronskaya,
They turn white: that's really on Tverskaya
And now everything is dark for me, Tanya:
They put him right in front of Tanya,
Their daughters hug Tanya.
She's old; her mind is getting dull, Tanya;
How he was attracted to Tanya,
Who is the old Tanya, poor Tanya
My mother begged; for poor Tanya
I'm crying if your Tanya
God must have ordered it that way. My Vanya
The children ran to Anisya
She called Polina Praskovya
And I, perhaps, am the tomb
But I, loving, was stupid and dumb.
And he's still a good member of the club,
Blushing like a palm cherub,
Between the old songs of the almanac
A sad and dangerous eccentric,
Delighted by the thunder of music,
The fact that fashion is autocratic
Its empty purpose is pathetic;
But the one who foresees everything is pathetic,
And the cuckold is majestic,
Meanwhile, the mechanic is rustic,
Step in a wide arc,
Now our roads are bad,
He answers her. Head
To amuse the half - dead,
And hears a voice: well? dead.
Bowing his tired head,
And a wayward head,
She sits with a drooping head
The other one with a rooster's head,
And he bows his head
To him with a guilty head.
In that pile, see? ahead,
And quietly aim at the pale forehead
Before you with death on your forehead,
And swearing, and a saber, and lead.
And on the last one you will read:
And what about it? His eyes read,
And I fed it with gingerbread!
I'm coming! It's scary to reread
Frost flashed. And we are glad
But you are exhausted from the road;
A wolf comes out on the road;
Just along the main road
He rushes her along the forest road;
Amber on the tubes of Tsargrad,
In the wilderness of Moldova sad
The hermit is idle and sad,
And she goes into the garden to be sad,
Still sad, why be sad?..
I'm not coming. And she's still sad,
And again thoughtful, sad
And for a long time my heart was sad.
Yes, the one who is sad
Was he embarrassed, the singer is sad,
But now the monument is sad
Used to be virginally sad,
Half-funny, half-sad,
And the secret of the marriage bed,
It glitters and curls; but the bed
She gets out of bed.
That my uncle is dying in bed
He used to be still in bed:
I took it off, undressed and went to bed
Sleep is running in her bed;
She can't sleep in her new bed,
And finally in my bed
How early could he have disturbed
And the hearts of the sorrowful will be noticed.
And, near him, she was noticed,
Inspected, re-upholstered, reinforced
The Larins produced
As a sign of friendship, the faithful have been introduced,
In both hearts, the heat faded;
In carriages heavily loaded,
The neighbor decided.
What do you want more? The light has decided,
They had already decided.
The letter is ready, folded
A pleasant lot commanded;
I foresee everything: you will be offended
How the life of a poet is simple-minded,
The one whose appearance vaguely reminded
Debauchery used to be cold-blooded
The manor house is secluded,
Sorry, the shelter is secluded!
They're flying home at full speed.
Rushing uphill at full speed;
And so they both aged.
And the secular rabble encouraged,
In many ways, he would have changed,
But soon everything changed:
Suddenly everything changed,
How Tatiana has changed!
The golden coal is tinged;
In his wheelchair, discharged
For the heart of the Russian it has merged!
In the evening, sometimes they converged
And yet her soul ached,
That's how Eugene preached.
Onegin was vividly touched:
That he was really touched,
But finally she sighed
In the old days, they triumphed
In the transparent darkness, he flashed,
Lensky was behind her; the light flashed;
The pistols have already flashed,
Without them, Onegin is finished.
Vice has always been punished,
How I made a mistake, how I was punished.
When the flame of passion is extinguished,
She was all stunned and flushed
It's spilling onto the shelf. Toothed,
The life-giving voice has died,
Is he still the same or has he been pacified?
And she's really terrified.:
I got used to it and became satisfied.
Acutely or not, I could have lied.
But everyone in the living room is occupied
Hugging each other, they cried.
She is grabbed and carried;
Tsimlyanskoe is already being carried;
It's time, it's time for her to get married!..
Parted with the muses, got married,
And at thirty he is advantageously married;
Those who felt it are worried
She was unhurried,
The deceased was buried.
Aspens, birches and lime trees naked
And how the bacchante frolicked,
Their rooms are locked,
Shutters are closed, windows are chalked
Twice a year they talked;
That's how Vechor casually joked.
When she came to her senses, Tatiana looked:
So she sat down quietly and looked,
Hooves, trunks are crooked,
Tatiana flushed and trembled.
In him, the ardor of the soul would have cooled.
Putting a bug in the sled,
It's already dark: he's getting into the sled.
Sometimes the one that is named
Others even claimed,
His soul was warmed
Their branches are all burdened
Lensky is defeated; the shadows are terrible thickened;
It was completely deepened.
By candlelight, Schiller opened;
And finally they opened
The Mazurka was heard. It happened,
Well, Mother? What happened?
At the cry of her frightened
The old duelist intervened;
At these words, he drained
And all the neighbors were entertained.
Their hand was not stained,
Perhaps the feeling is old-fashioned
He turned away and yawned,
And the roar of the skripok drowned
Her younger breasts were cramped;
He leaves the party cramped,
My Onegin has already galloped.
Or do mo and dropped
She stopped.
She stopped.
In the fields, the noise of work has stopped;
But then it was stopped,
Or she suddenly became pale, red
She is round, her face is red,
I was scared.
Love has passed, the muse has appeared,
Noticing that Vladimir had disappeared,
Jealousy and annoyance disappeared
The happiness of the young years has disappeared,
And the whole gang suddenly disappeared;
By God! Not that she shuddered.
How sarcastically he slandered!
And finally squandered.
When the Mazurka thunder thundered,
Before Onegin gathered
Enemies and friends gathered,
Where are the two neighbors gathered
Has her crown withered, withered?
Instant flame covered,
With a kerchief on his head, gray-haired,
Ebullient, dark and gray-haired
It's time for the festivities of inspired
And the thought of her inspired
And here, I'm completely tired,
I am bored,
The village where Eugene was bored,
Who will never get bored?
They should always be honored;
I know: my age has already been measured;
A general alarm will be raised.
The youth of the summer would have passed:
Many, many days have passed
Sleeping peacefully in the shadow of the blessed
How was she dressed
And he was getting dressed
How dandy london is dressed
He's going home to get dressed.
Onegin is in a hurry to get dressed,
Put them back in the drawer and undressed,
Everyone is very impressed
The evening samovar hissed,
Four steps crossed,
All the feelings in Lensky were confused,
The gang of brownies was confused;
Guillot becomes confused.
He is both hurt and amused,
To which we dedicated
To whom the heart was dedicated,
And the one with whom he is educated
All this is now dilapidated,
And finally updated
And the old thing is outdated,
The days raced by; the air was heated
It is monotonous and variegated.
In the last century, the belated;
That the wedding is completely coordinated,
All prejudices have been eliminated,
How much it resonated!
Like a victim, magnificently decorated
But now the crowd hesitated,
His raptures were expected.
A simple monument has been erected.
This is how our century is being corrected!
There our Katenin resurrected
And I waited
In the morning, the Larins' house is visited
Vladimir Lensky visited
This verse was printed;
In all albums, blunted,
Interrupting the conversation that started,
She was completely comforted:
It was so sweetly distorted,
They appeared; they were wasted
No one was so interested:
My mind is exhausted,
So that the child does not get exhausted,
And it is certainly committed
Always unjustly persecuted,
Reduced, continued.
Monsieur Triquet also arrived,
The company commander arrived;
A fat Trifle has arrived;
Olga's admirer has arrived.
Now the doubts are solved:
Suddenly his fate will be resolved.
Winter has already been resolved;
Where I suffered, where I loved,
He sees that he is still loved;
The attention of the friendship of the beloved,
The sleepy well was moved,
It was usually served
There was Prolasov, who deserved
He stands with his head bowed,
His living tears flowed;
Yes, it was obvious that the mail was delayed.
Eight Roberts have already played
Sometimes white-eyed
Surprised, amazed,
Onegin was amazed,
The young viewer is amazed
Or over the Summer euthanized
But suddenly Tatiana became afraid
I was so afraid!
She has no time to lift; she is afraid,
As Sadi once said.
And he said:
Remember what the satirist said!
That's not it, God forbid!
There are two verses from the Aeneid.
That's right the old invalid
In love, being considered an invalid,
Ivan Petrovich is just as stupid,
Yes, she was stupid.
Got it, then the maidens look languid,
Like Chd-Harod, sullen, languid
He was already angry. But the maid is languid
The beauty is pleasantly languid!
On the third there is a grove, a hill and a field
However, it's too dark in the field;
A noisy swarm is flying to the field.
The bee behind the tribute field
And he looks into the dark field.
Fishing fire. In a clean field,
And he walks in an open field,
I'm in love with Tatiana like a child;
How often did I play as a child
With an obedient doll child
Love, like a sweet child.
Fun and luxury child.
A flirt, a flighty child!
Dear friend, I'm too old,
The habits of the dear old;
And I was thirteen years old.
From thirty to two years old;
The horn and the song are bold
Two legs Sad, cold,
Meanwhile, with a feigned cold
So the storms of autumn are cold
And now the blood is getting cold,
Instantly doused with cold,
But winters are sometimes cold
As soon as I remember the look is cold
But it's too late. The wind got cold.
She is the Epiphany cold!
He doesn't need gold.,
Meadows and fields of gold,
Then I took care of the household,
Direct Onegin Child-Harold
And he will lead a baptized world
He and lyra traveled the world;
I would be sad to leave the world.
Maybe he's for the good of the world.
Otherwise, she would have driven me out of the world
From the cold debauchery of the world
We will also be ousted from the world!
The other one!.. No, no one in the world
What could be worse in the world
Yeah! It's been a long time since you've been in the world.
How are you and I, like the whole world?
The vagaries of the big world!
And I would be as happy as I could!
What does he hear? She could
And the same Pomeranian, and the same husband;
He was caressed by his evil husband,
Then she turned to her husband
Come, come: I am your husband!..
Sad about an unworthy husband,
I almost divorced my husband;
All this without asking my husband.
Does not see anyone who has a hand
But so be it with a biased hand
She baptized with an old hand.
It's like a cold hand
And even with a trembling hand
She leaned on her trembling hand
His unfeeling hand
To the Princess with a weak hand
They go to the table hand in hand.
They are in the garden, hand in hand,
With in hand!
But with a crimson hand
The letter trembles in her hand;
Spilled by Olga's hand,
Onegin waved his hand,
Clutching the gun with his hand,
Straightened his hair with his hand,
Turning to her with a piece of paper in his hand,
Whose benevolent hand
Killed by a friendly hand!
Nature than Chateaubriand,
As a tribute to the finished land.
Saving the honor of the native land,
And the moats of the paternal land.
They, by stern command
My Tatiana understand
To listen to you for a long time, to understand
I found an untimely end!
Almost at that time I did not comprehend
But you, Bordeaux, are like a friend.,
I'm shooting with a friend.
To break up now as a friend.
The younger virgo is with him himself-a friend;
Onegin, my good friend,
A warm friend, a welcome friend,
Smitten by a young friend,
To take care of me like a faithful friend,
So your faithful friend
I'm singing a younger friend
Thoughtfulness, her friend
With sad Tanya, our friend;
Long live Bordeaux, our friend!
My windy friend.
My family and my friend.
Yes, however, to my friend
Love is a dreamy friend.
With her my lips will find
Or a dull gaze will not find
Here you will certainly find
And he is stubborn, he does not want to fall behind,
But death from him is kind.
With a sensitive soul, with a mind
And a sharp, chilled mind.
With his embittered mind,
Who, having calmed down a cold mind,
How is it with your heart and mind
Who is with his heart and mind
Incomprehensible to the mind;
Still captivated the young mind.
Why do you have me in mind?
Suddenly a thought was born in her mind
What do I need in your mind?
And everything is on Eugene's mind,
The waltz is spinning, a noisy whirlwind;
Ready to relive the bond,
Has the word been found?
I went, but I just turned around
It's a pity I don't have the time to drive around.;
Here's a yard boy running around,
Night will come; the moon is going around
From the end, from the beginning and all around.
Everything is bright, everything is white all around.
There is noise and crowding all around;
Monsters are sitting all around:
Dotted with bowls all around,
Barely breathing; she circles around
There are a lot of neighbors around;
And they expose the forest around.
When we are motionless, on the ground
So the fallen grain falls into the ground
It reminded me of at least one sound.
Moscow how much is in this sound
Eavesdrop on the heart's first sound,
Blood flowed steaming from the wound.
So you're married! I didn't know about the wound!
He's going to shoot himself, thank God,
That's the way of education, thank God,
Warmed by inspiration from God,
I gave my word, so what? By God
I know you were sent to me by God.,
And, friends, no one, by God!
Onegin. Oh, my God, my God!
A substitute for happiness. Oh my God!
And she will squeak (my God!):
The advice is reasonable and good;
To whom I sing, that's good
Spinning in a red hood,
There is an impatient splashing in the neighborhood,
Tanya is young in the neighborhood,
I gave a reason in the neighborhood:
In cold blood,
They prepare death in cold blood
The coquette judges in cold blood,
To subdue the excitement in the blood;
I used to pee in blood
In my soul, in my blood!
Your own style in an important mood,
Updates the path on the firewood;
The hammer rattles on the ramrod.
A prolonged howl is heard,
And the key dialect is heard,
He carries us for the forest and lard,
Malek-Adele and de Linard,
At his coffin board,
Clung quietly to the headboard?
They are above the chessboard,
Melancholy was waiting for him on guard,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
An invaluable reward,
A report from the steward,
Monseur was chased out of the yard.
He's leaving the yard,
Forty merry people in the yard
Eight nags were being led into the yard,
That's closer! They also jump into the yard
Maids from all over the yard
It was already November at the yard.
It's been a long time since we left the yard.
Is it helpful for our yard?
About the rain, about flax, about the barnyard
In the morning, the whitewashed courtyard,
And he enters the deserted courtyard.
Tatiana on the wide courtyard
And the guests are coming from the courtyard.
At the dawn of the shepherd
Oh, my early bird!
He sat down at the harpsichord
Satires the bold lord,
Don't let him say a word.,
He's a chilling word
Yes, Olga has already given her word
I really love this word,
The pharaoh is throwing his motley sword.
But a wildly secular feud
He distinguished himself, bravely in the mud
Here the skeleton is prim and proud,
Our language is still proud
Archived young men in a crowd
She is in front of a cold crowd,
Sharing feelings with the crowd,
But who is this in the chosen crowd
And following the orderly crowd
The cherished monogram Oh yes e.
At the end of the letter, put ae,
But their choice seemed to be
So our windy tribe
I would wear a quilted robe;
There are two hearts about him, maybe,
I thought: freedom and peace
Smile, virgin peace,
He's always with her. In her peace
Under the stone, this one tastes peace.
And his bones are at peace
Her sad face.
In her proud face
Always in fashion and to the face;
And an attractive face.
One with horns and a dog's face,
She looks at his face.
There is only a trace of anger on this face
She preferred Lovelace;
The table is set in front of the fireplace,
The ladies sat down by the fireplace;
In winter, on the cast iron fireplace,
He excluded from the disgrace:
He plants cabbage like Horace,
Without an inconspicuous trace
On blue, excised ice
The wrong one is hooking the ice,
Treads carefully on the ice,
Ice skates soundly cuts the ice;
The river shines, it is clothed with ice.
Innocent years of prejudice
Everything decorated the office
This is the master's office;
And in a silent office,
And in the silent office
Flying in the dust on the post office,
That he's smart and very nice.
Her portrait: he is very nice,
Which is very nice.
Hear my sad voice:
Magazines heeding the pleading voice,
And soon Olya's ringing voice
And she spoke in a singsong voice,
I will hear your magical voice!
Or not, sir. That was the general voice.
Enemies, friends, mistresses voice
Listening to their sonorous voice,
But she, the sisters, did not notice,
Who cares about our vice?
But without asking her advice,
At least my advice
Yawning, listen to the prayer service,
Selfish insignificance
I mean her insignificance
There are songs, a round dance;
To our round dance,
Approaching the moment of vengeance,
I marveled at their fashionable arrogance,
What, spleen or suffering arrogance
To my performance:
His unexpected appearance,
Meanwhile, Onegin's appearance
They sleep on fur coats at the entrance;
Gave them the Inheritance,
Movements, voice, light stance,
And we were captivated in the distance
And She ran after me into the distance.
Fate has brought her into the distance,
At a noble distance;
And something, and a vague distance,
No cooling distance,
Is Onegin striving? You are in advance
And I was yawning in advance,
Without ceasing to advance,
Or even himself in a passionate annoyance
Tatiana listened with annoyance
Looking down in annoyance,
By the secret will of providence,
They flash in my eyes like a fence.
Stable, kitchen and fence.
Curtains, roofs and fence,
And words of amiable negligence?
But a husband with honor and intelligence.
Have you written to me with such intelligence?
Neither sharpness nor intelligence,
No noise of fun, no science
His example to others is science;
We did not pass without science,
Your trusting conscience
Whose heart has been cooled by experience
I had a dreary experience.
I ask for your patience:
Solitude, silence:
Listening in the noise and in the silence
And in the noise of the light and in the silence
And a share in idle silence,
Where is it long in the bosom of silence
In the bosom of rural silence!
For rural silence;
Amid worries and in silence,
At first they look around in silence
And I have to die in silence.
You spoke to me in silence,
Near the waters that shone in silence,
And he hung his nose in silence.
And everything was dozing in silence
He drops the gun in silence,
He bowed to her in silence,
They are each other in silence
Give lessons in silence!
He keeps a deep silence.
Prudent silence,
Privacy, silence,
I'm always happy to notice the difference.
He was given a general sentence.
And the enterprising Prince;
And he could have been in the company of a prince
The younger maiden will replace me more than once
In a paper cap, more than once
Of course, you've seen it more than once
And Tanya was elbowed at once,
Anisya came to her at once,
Is it striking with such force?
Gold earrings will be torn out by force;
Words: forest, storm, witch, spruce,
There's a thick one by the stream in the shade
Walking through a snow glade,
The goddess is going to a masquerade.
All this rags of the masquerade,
Martin Zadeka will not decide;
No one else was looking for a bride.
Like Byron, the poet of pride,
And the cold of calm pride,
With what heavenly pride
And we will direct our way to the side,
The dream of the other side,
In the sky on the left side,
In the remote, distant side,
Here the mill is dancing side by side
So that the flutter of her heart would subside,
More outside and inside
I'm not going to enjoy myself on the outside,
Harold, a Quaker, a prude,
Forests and fields of solitude,
And in the cruel solitude
One day to them in solitude
I replaced it with a light fee;
He slept here, ate coffee,
Then I drank my coffee,
When will I start running free?
She sits quietly and is free.
Where everything is safe, everything is free,
And that's right, you would agree,
On the branches of a bowed pine tree,
To myself, to the mysterious tree;
I have to admit it, I see.
And why, I don't see.)
Tatiana looks and does not see,
But you see
Believe me (conscience is a guarantee),
I am a member of the ancient corvee
Eugene's fate kept him safe:
Aspires to a field life,
About the boredom of a single life;
He was famous for his love life,
He sang the faded color of life
Alas! on the reins of life
You will learn the bliss of life,
Spoiled by the habit of life,
To complete the humble way of life!
Like the whirlwind of a young life,
To the beginning of a young life.
They kept it in a peaceful life
I was born for a peaceful life,
Who is gradually getting cold in life
But he has completely cooled down to life.
Take a break from the past life.
Would you really know life,
You, the ghost of an unearthly life,
This is Onegin's holy life;
I've ruined a lot of my life!
But to prolong my life,
The sad dawn of a stormy life!..
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
Children and faithful wife
Families with a poor wife
His lunch and his wife.
Yawned with friends and with his wife,
At the snow and at his wife.
For a virtuous wife
With his portly wife
Life is so disgusting in old age
Why is it fruitless to argue with the age?
Where to go headlong in the Yamskaya carriage
There is a place: to the left of the village,
Spending the summer in the village,
Spring is calling you to the village,
In the wilderness of a forgotten village
To see you in our village,
But after arriving at my uncle's village,
He left his village,
And now from a nearby village
They put on a single image,
I kept their secret image;
He had no desire to rummage
He lives like a true sage,
To look at life as a rite of passage,
After reading the sad message,
He's writing a passionate message.
But after receiving Tanya's message,
There is jumping and noise on the stage;
Then to the stage
Familiar faces on the boring stage,
In your native language,
First, Onegin's language
My whole life has been a pledge
All the best as a pledge,
I was captured: a dredge pledge!
A trembling, disastrous bridge,
People I don't judge,
She's already learned how to change!
A cab pulls to the stock exchange,
He lay motionless, and strange
They find her strange,
Are we up to the task and not strange?
And certainly a lot of revenge.
Pleased with his revenge.
Here is my Onegin at large;
Yes, I remember, I remember. Where is he?
My poor Lensky, he
He is welcomed. She
It's been a long time since a heartache
But, to know, heartache
Jumps, heels, mustache
The same friend Monsieur Finmouche,
To her village, where she,
Istomina is standing; she,
When she's riding headlong she
With a silk pattern, she
Plunging into dreams, she;
In the eyes of her parents, she
Tatiana is being touched; but she
The twilight is thinning; but she
He stares stubbornly: she
Under the sky of Schiller and Goethe
He won't move, he won't die;
A funny joke, a lie.
And where his ashes lie,
I love you (why lie?),
And Strasbourg is an imperishable pie
Beef steaks and Strasbourg pie
Five versts from Krasnogorie,
I wander over a deserted lake,
Wandering over my lake,
And even though he was an ardent rake,
Come on, honey, for God's sake.
I didn't repeat it a hundred times by mistake;
Hereditary enemies are like,
O people! You all look alike
Tatiana is almost alive; Trike,
My heart will not tremble, even for a joke.
Or (but this is no joke),
All this glitter, and noise, and smoke
There was a messenger who spoke
As if hearing an angry rebuke.
He sometimes reads to Ole
The herds are noisy, and the nightingale
Sitting, not cleaned, pale,
She was trembling and turning pale.
Onegin begins to turn pale:
From the tableau, the list is pale
Nature is tremulous, pale,
The British Muse is a tall tale
Our threes are indefatigable,
But they say you are unsociable;
Their conversation is reasonable
And soon they became inseparable.
But with him, I know, it is inseparable
Why is it so unfavorable
The cue was resting on the billiard table,
Still hissing in the middle of the table.
They put a waxed one on the table
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
I found it on the table,
And what does he see?.. at the table
She was sitting at the table
Onegin is sitting at the table
The crowd buzzes, sitting down at the table.
And they have guests at the table
And sat at the table.
He's on a two-ball pool table
He lies with his childish babble.
And all that kind of rabble
Who was no stranger to the secular rabble,
And Tanya is not so terrible,
I knew beauties who were inaccessible,
And happiness was so possible,
Appliances, chairs as soon as possible;
Implacable, incorruptible,
And the heart makes us tremble
It will not be important to disassemble,
She fell into the snow; the bear was nimble
In the wilderness, under the shadow of a humble,
The neighbor's monument is humble,
I don't grumble: why grumble?
That I am rich and noble,
Hm! Hm! The reader is noble,
Inexperience leads to trouble.
Father or old uncle,
The death of the old man's uncle.
And at the noon hour in a circle
When would life be a domestic circle
In the high London circle
Gardens, palaces are a semicircle
Between the mountains lying in a semicircle,
The bride is a vast semicircle,
Has she solved the riddle?
He does not fit the ladies to the handle;
Or some other trifle
Snoring is a heavy trifle
The father of the family is single,
A riding crop. Tanya dahle;
Or to make them reconcile
Forgetting everything for a while,
Galloping, mazurka, waltz Meanwhile,
I was reading, forgetting myself, meanwhile
Time passes; meanwhile
Keeps silent meanwhile
Caught and glory meanwhile;
Which would be your friend with a smile,
And the light greeted her with a smile;
He listened to Lensky with a smile.
Like rosy lips without a smile,
And then what happens with an evil smile
Nature with a clear smile
And make the ladies smile
A languid mind will not smile,
But at a late age and infertile,
Here's the gunpowder in a grayish trickle
I read the works of Fontenelle,
But my Onegin evening is whole
How firmly she has entered into her role!
And aim at the thigh or the temple.
Now it's kind and simple
In love, poor and simple,
And by the way: Larina is simple,
Blind Fortune and people
And, according to the custom of the people,
On the day of Trinity, when the people,
Between reasonable people
The choirs are full of people,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
The custom is despot among people.
Boys are a joyful people
He goes away and calls people.
That nonsense is important to important people
In a circle of decent people,
And a golden pineapple.
Cattle, a gray-haired couple,
But the food was served. The couple
The couple flashes by the couple.
I'll lead them down the aisle.
Where he waves a tinsel mantle
How his gaze was quick and gentle,
Sometimes he seemed more gentle,
To visit a deserted castle,
How is he, lagging behind the hustle and bustle,
And I can say that I got into a battle
Who proudly challenged you to battle,
Half-crane and half-cattle.
The music is too tired to rattle;
Plates and cutlery rattle
Warm up at his place a little!
I opened the door a little
It took hold of him little by little;
To admit: the taste is very little
Pour champagne over a bottle
Yes, in a salted bottle,
The one who insulted you behind the bottle,
To her porch, the glass vestibule
To get better in business and in style,
Well, my poor style
Another poet with a luxurious style
And with a gullible dazzle
My father blessed me.
Your wonderful look tormented me,
And to think: he loved me,
Between Onegin and me,
Introduce me.
Not everyone will understand you like me.;
What does my fate promise me?
I'm asking you to leave me;
You won't leave me.
Tatiana's letter is in front of me;
You were right in front of me:
Are you following me?
She rode a horse with me!
If you were still with me,
Open the window and sit down with me.
Onegin was ready with me
So that he doesn't call me
Well, he says, you tell me,
Now you need to find out from me,
Let him write further than me.
Gallicisms will be nice to me,
How sad is your appearance to me,
A stray neighbor came to me,
He dedicated one to me
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
And he said: You wrote to me,
It's more charming than anything to me.
You're not listening to me.
Or is pleasure alien to me,
Suddenly he opened up to me!
The day is dear to me, the hour is dear to me:
The muse began to appear to me.
The home circle is dearer to me,
Invisible, you were too sweet to me,
And I thought: it's stupid to bother me
To see this Phyllida for me,
He was expecting Olga for me.,
But the north is bad for me.
What does the coming day have in store for me?
Howling foolishly: it's me!
No one understands me,
I can't understand him; it bothers me
But you miss me
She wouldn't hurt me.
And it's time to come without me;
Come here, follow me.
Sorry. Why would you follow me
He's not here. They don't know me
The stanza composed by me;
Or at least he was born for fame;
Recently, he is proud of his fame.
We both knew the passion game;
And the fear of vice and shame,
Afraid of false shame.
In the confusion of tender shame,
Lucky man, he did not shame:
Believe me: my shame
Is it not because my shame
He looked at the menacing flame.
For the first time with such a name
Suddenly it stops. About one name
They did not know needles; leaning on an embroidery frame,
You're bigger somehow. No, it's the same.
The boredom in the village is the same,
Just to spend time,
Her walks last a fraction of the time.
And dinner. We know the time
To his village at the same time
Or quiet to share leisure time.
And curses their leisure time,
Girls jump ahead of time;
But he's not going; he's ahead of time
It's a pretty boring time;
I don't read much, I sleep a long time,
Divorced for a long time.
And she cried for a long time.
That I haven't sinned for a long time.
I stood in the yard for a long time,
That they've been waiting for her at home for a long time,
Tatiana walked alone for a long time.
Tortured by the verse for a long time,
What has everyone been sure of for a long time,
I've stopped loving reading for a long time,
Tatiana has been in the fashionable cell for a long time
On a dead soul for a long time
Did her heart suffer for a long time,
Have they been leisure hours for a long time,
I've been putting up with ballets for a long time,
They have not been new to us for a long time.
Ah! I couldn't forget for a long time
Eugene could not stand it for a long time:
Have I forgotten for you for a long time
I've been waiting impatiently for a long time;
Blessed is he who matured in time,
I remember another time!
The vaunted grandfather's time:
It would have been a long time ago (wouldn't it?) It's time!
It's time, it's time!
He looks and sees that it's time
He remembered it was time,
In the wilderness, what to do at this time?
To walk? The village of that time
I became friends with him at that time.
There was also a groom at that time
I was sleeping like a dead man at that time.
He waved his hand one last time
For those places where the first time,
And the trigger clicked for the first time.
Spring brings him to life: for the first time
Appeared to me for the first time
And now I am a muse for the first time
I met you by chance sometime,
I'll finish it after sometime.
And interrupted him in the meantime
Our time will come, our time will come,
A rustic evening will come:
Will the hour of my freedom come?
Now I have to come;
The golden autumn has come.
A bad turn has come!
They're sitting. The words won't come
He's bringing a terrible treasure home.
It's time, it's time to go home.
For our poor home,
Will he go home, and at home
Onegin locked himself in at home,
Having many things to do at home,
The poet is waiting for an answer at home;
Freely accepts at home,
He falls asleep quietly at home
Reeez ous, bee endorme.
Yes, Marmontel's third volume.
Let's chase the naughty rhyme,
Monotonous and insane,
And the condescending Eugene,
But he was wrong: Eugene
Your gun then Eugene,
It's time for Eugene,
Shining eyes, Eugene
Although we know that Eugene
She's gone. It's worth it Eugene,
He immediately went out; but Eugene
Who is he? Is it really Eugene?
The argument is louder, louder; suddenly Eugene
Of course, not only Eugene
He was not stupid; and my Eugene,
And everyone is shouting: mine! Mine!
A novel in the taste of La Fontaine
But neither Virgil nor Racine,
It's sad to bring medicine,
You don't have time to imagine
Clarice, Julia, Delphine,
Calmly I got in line,
Running in a stormy line
Or rather, we'll start it online;
Similar to the English spline,
During your time and mine),
In the village where Eugene is mine,
A peaceful dream. Onegin is mine
The blush is brighter. Lensky is mine
Imagining herself to be a heroine?
Before the young heroine,
A glass of red wine;
Blessed wine
The bottle popped; the wine
A glass full of wine,
And a friendly glass of wine
A bottle of light wine,
About haymaking, about wine,
Not even a Ladies Fashion Magazine
Into the fire, then a shoe, then a magazine.
They tenderly demand one.
In home life, we see one
It was a pleasant, noble one,
Have you turned to your native one?
They came together, and no one
He's in the hall; next: no one.
I would have chosen another one.,
And I couldn't think of a better one.
No longer love; as one
He's a pharmacist; he drinks one
Now it's a holiday for the jealous one!
An office enters the silent one
And it's nice to fool a smart one,
That the ballet has started a new one.
I am temporarily fascinated by one,
Where Terpsichore is the only one
And that mediocrity is the only one
Horns and fingers are made of bone,
The soul was waiting for someone,
That's gone
And where, God knows. The trace was gone.
Where, where have you gone,
Fonvizin, a friend of freedom, shone,
I was busy with Tatiana alone,
He finds Tatiana alone,
Go on, leave me alone.
Imagine: I'm here alone,
To read books here alone.
Accessible to feeling alone;
Both in the afternoon and in the evening alone;
The Princess is in front of him, alone,
And then she's alone
Rushing through the fields alone,
Yes, she wanders through the woods alone.
Sorry. And here she is alone.
In the desert, where Eugene is alone
There is a long row of dinners alone,
Who won't cheat on us alone?
Here the gentleman sat alone.
I probably would have chosen you alone.
That's right, except for you alone
I'm finally alone,
She does not say: let's postpone
It retains the same tone,
They got together. Wave and Stone,
Zaretsky condemned the millstone.
And he doesn't share it with anyone.
Unnoticed by anyone,
He seems like a stranger to everyone.
It's time to get a girl, she-she, It's time; but what should I do with her? It's the same thing for everyone
Without a brazen look for everyone,
Tatiana thanks everyone.
Now I would be noticed by everyone,
More gentle than a pipe tune:
This song is a pitiful tune;
Did you dedicate her tune?
She was waiting for misfortune.
Perhaps to my misfortune,
But a horse with a blunted horseshoe
Two perches, glued together by an ice floe,
Tatiana from head to toe;
To name; but from head to toe
Flying towards him on tiptoe,
When would I have had hope
You're in a blaze of hope.
Perhaps (a flattering hope!),
He was cherished by hope,
It is like a windy hope,
From the lung of Europe,
To ride on horseback in the harsh steppe?
On the charms of her steppe
The words and gaze of these witches are
How full her breasts are!
Oh, darling, how prettier you are
I have them; here they are:
But what do I care?
My Tatiana doesn't care.
Half the world has a share,
I didn't want to stay in the share,
Ulan, his slave share,
For the sounds of life, do not spare,
And it would be possible to be noble Here
And the old gentleman lived here;
Highway Russia here and here,
There's a witch with a goatee here,
In his face? Why is he here?
There seem to be smart people here
Two friends came here,
It's easy to shine here.
Not seeing a bit of sense here,
At least there is no romanticism here
I can't sleep, Nanny: it's so stuffy in here!
It's not the first time he's shown up here
He was wearing fragrant gray hair here
There were elderly ladies here
Vladimir Lensky lies here,
Comparing my features here,
He's here! Eugene is here!
The bear said: My godfather is here:
There were several girls here,
He was a sucker for epigrams here,
By the way, there are two words about that here:
Describe his outfit here;
There is not much elegant here.
I can't understand. But here
There is a carla with a ponytail, but here
I looked in twice, and there
Villages flashed by; here and there
Petrovsky Castle. Well! Don't stand there,
The coffin stone is visible there
But there will be a lot of people there
The peasants are all rich there,
What's waiting for him there?
There's dinner, it's time to sleep there,
Where are the tear stains?.. They are not there, they are not there!
The ploughman likes to rest there,
Go away! The pillars of the outpost are already there
The glow goes out. There's a valley there
When it happened somewhere
There's not a speck of ink anywhere.
You imagine everywhere
Trumpeting about himself everywhere
Lanterns are shining everywhere;
There is an affectionate meeting everywhere,
You'll have to resurrect it from everywhere:
It's no wonder to keep up everywhere.
It's all in the wilderness; he's everywhere
There are foxes everywhere,
Onegin's soul is everywhere
There are high chambers everywhere,
Comrade, always, everywhere,
Follow you everywhere,
She was preparing a fire
Not with poetic fire,
Their poetic fire
Poetry and prose, ice and fire
Warmed by a virgin fire.
Poor Tatiana is on fire;
We will revive it with Jealous fire;
Before the slow fire
Spring is enlivened by fire.
And, as if burned by fire,
Or a brooding Vampire,
We slowly languish in desire,
But, my God, what a bore
It was not there: as before,
He left all of you before;
However, the leg of Terpsichore
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
Affectation, nothing more.
She liked him much more:
He was not interested in more;
I'm writing to you, what's more?
From hour to hour the captive is more
In which the author knows more
They captivated her heart more.
And she has no strength to run anymore.
I'm still sad; but there are no tears anymore,
I can't resist anymore;
Sensing the dead, they snore
Gathering at night to conjure,
And, no one, I'm sure!
Is she really? But for sure
He rushed to Taon: he is sure,
Thank you for the pleasure,
And then, bored with pleasure,
She is between business and leisure
Languishing in idle leisure
Sometimes, in late leisure
The current of rural leisure
But the waywardness of nature,
Then, obeying nature,
Sorry, cheerful nature;
All this is low nature;
Or with a lively nature
Will I depict the faithful in the picture
He stood like a magazine picture,
When would it be a family picture
Once in a real rapture
With his caring posture,
Hisses; and so with an important posture,
Or a dove on the lyre
With your loquacious lyre;
His silent lyre
To disturb with my lyre,
Besides, this is the case
Poems have been preserved in case;
For your protection, please
Breeds ducks and geese
A caravan of noisy geese
The edge of the clothes is ashamed to raise;
And thirst for fame and praise,
Weaning our hearts from praise,
I do not live and write for praise;
So circumspect, so precise,
And the curtain rises And makes a noise.
She was getting naked with a sad noise,
And the world's new brilliance and noise
Let's go listen to the oakwood noise
He was bored with the light and the noise;
I woke up in the morning with a pleasant noise.
To warn the dawn sunrise,
To appropriate the mind of someone else;
But I'm given to someone else.;
Changed it to something else.
Enough, sing about something else!
An insignificant ghost, or else
Noticing the trembling impulse,
Don't you want to? trust the expense,
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Full of love nonsense,
She gave birth to a lot of nonsense,
Or a long tale of living nonsense,
That there is no such nonsense,
Such incoherent, vulgar nonsense;
Who inspired her with tender nonsense,
There's boredom, there's deception or nonsense;
That all my zealous nonsense
Obnoxious, though innocent nonsense;
And even funny nonsense
And now the neighbor is grandiose
She could pronounce it through her nose;
And he began to wander without a purpose,
He sat down with a laudable purpose
What do I want? for what purpose
(The reader is waiting for the rhyme of the rose;
I will stoop to humble prose;
Summers tend to be harsh prose,
I'm not used to postal prose.
He leaves a gentle verse,
Transforming yourself into a horse;
It turns out that he demands a horse
Sensing him, the road horse
Falling off the Kalmyk horse,
The bridle is an obedient and zealous horse,
That one is gnawing at remorse.
In the anguish of heartfelt remorse,
He is already tormented by remorse,
Who, for better or for worse,
And to harass, and to curse,
I only read to the old nurse.,
Over my poor nurse
Although he knew people, of course
At least I'll go back to him, of course,
Poems will be put into use;
People's tears, applause
Crooked talk, noise and abuse!
Then know: the barb of your abuse,
Maybe I'm giving you an excuse!
They will refuse
O you epic muse!
With my wayward muse
But the one who is cherished by the muse,
How often is the affectionate muse
I brought a frisky muse
From the hill, the lord sees a house,
Now it's like an empty house,
And the first snow from the roof of the bathhouse
Quietly ordered in the bathhouse
When would I be a father, a spouse
I discovered the secret as a spouse
Besides, the opinions of the spouse
There would be a faithful spouse
The future ignoramus will indicate
Eugene is immediately on a date
What was the consequence of the date?
To achieve a secret date
And the slave blessed fate.
But soon we were the fate
What are the chosen of fate,
Condemned by a domineering fate:
The ordinary one was waiting for fate.
The whole story of your fate.
Appointed by a strict fate?
But so be it! My fate
The days counted by fate.
And, saved by fate,
And I surrender to my fate.
I've already given up my fate.
So close!.. But my fate
The servants have come running to the gate
A cart in front of the house at the gate
Sliding, crawls out the gate.
And the sleigh, and the dawn is late
Which I sometimes get late
In his wilderness, the sage is desolate,
Besides, they are so immaculate,
Its with a disparate
Some kind of army pete
This unpleasant tete-a-tete;
I read the skeptical White,
And lean on the granite,
How early could he be a hypocrite,
Onegin lived an anchorite:
And futile teases the appetite,
The boredom of the road is quite:
He could express himself and wrote;
Vladimir immediately wrote
A disappointed lorgnette,
And an obtrusive lorgnette
And an inattentive lorgnette.
And the signature: T. A. Annette;
What will it be now? Melmotte,
And the world is closed to him and mute?..
I was delighting in the path of the mute
Sometimes talkative, sometimes mute,
He's paying attention every minute
No, I see you every minute,
To remain silent in an important dispute
Starched brute,
Armed with a blunt cue,
The departure day is long overdue,
On an inflamed tongue.
They came to my tongue,
Where can I find an eclogue!
Where is the boring husband, knowing her value
The pipe smoke rises in a column of blue,
The skies are shining blue.
The moon is in the air blue.
Eyes like the sky, blue,
Is it really straight and true
He visited me on Christmas Eve;
Here are the Hussars on leave
But Lensky, of course, did not have,
Of course it would be brave,
Who died early by the death of the brave,
So indifferent, so brave?
My poor Lensky! Beyond the grave
And beyond the grave
In love to the grave;
You are my guardian to the grave
It makes noise, swirls with its own wave
Who should I love? Who should I believe?
To disbelieve, to make believe,
A poem of songs at twenty-five.
So bees from a delicious hive
Where did the inspiration pet live,
Creative dreams come alive.
Between the Limburg cheese alive
Passes with youth alive.
It seemed that she was almost alive,
Tatiana is barely alive.
She is insensitively submissive,
Not cold, not talkative,
He loves you so much like a native!
The conversation began to revive;
That there are no awards in the world above.
In front of her in the hall, and all above
Habit is given to us from above:
Until now, ladies' love
Scaring timid love,
Remembering the old love,
Enmity, hope and love,
The language of Petrarch and love.
The subject of songs and love,
Not you, with joy and love,
What is above a timid, gentle love
More longing, more love!..
For the good, pure love
We will multiply the price of love,
Innocent outpouring of love;
Where are the stormy desires of love,
But he finally fell out of love
Words of longing love,
And what about it? Intoxicated with love,
Satan is joking with love.
Lay down at her feet with love!
It's time, she fell in love.
I'm still condemned to love:
All ages are submissive to love;
He sang love, obedient to love,
Ah, maybe her love
Spring, spring! It's time for love!
Longing for love,
A humble girl's love?
His pen breathes love,
About Olga: such is love!
The care of youth is love?
And a wreath of sweet love
We haven't heard about love;
A picture of happy love.
But suddenly the snowdrift began to move.
In the shade of a protective oak grove
Here, surrounded by his oak grove,
A simpering cat sitting on the stove,
O you, whose memory will preserve
Unwittingly bothers the eye
I'm waiting for you: with one eye
She's a darkening eye
And Lensky, squinting his left eye,
His sick, faded gaze,
And an eternally inspired gaze,
Arming both speech and gaze,
She, prophesying to the gaze
And miles, to amuse the idle gaze,
He will see your stern gaze
Onegin fixed his sharp gaze:
Tatiana lowered her gaze,
Taking your curious gaze,
Surrounded by a sad haze;
Joking innocence amaze,
I'm enjoying the breeze
There used to be an early breeze
Who did your verse idolize?
Suddenly there's a stomp!.. Her blood froze.
Still humble, just as deaf
The unknown in the grass is deaf
Within the limits of eternity deaf
Then she will drop the handkerchief;
And he finds no relief
Habit has soothed grief,
And to dispel her grief,
He does not hear my grief.
And, handing me the faithful staff,
Others galloped off,
Tatiana saw them off.
Yawns are cold stuff
Well, a lot of good stuff.
And jokingly, with bile in half,
And my heart breaks in half.
With his heavy half.
How Pete described himself.
The poet expressed himself;
And he's ashamed to recognize himself;
He was innocently exposing himself.
Always happy with himself,
Sighs and appropriates to himself
Onegin sleeps deeply for himself.
He involuntarily expresses himself
He forced himself to respect himself
How could he forget himself!
The colonel sent it himself.
Everyone is amazed. Lensky himself
He handed it to her; she braced herself
His wife was herself
Love yourself,
Go with him and with yourself
Learn to control yourself;
Otherwise, my friend, you judge for yourself:
Sigh and think about yourself:
As soon as it's about yourself.
I was ready to sacrifice myself,
I had to prove myself
I was dissatisfied with myself.
I used to love him myself,
And I read it to myself.
Although sometimes I'm in a mess myself
I have sometimes met myself:
I saw everything: I flared up, I'm not myself;
With his hungry wolf
Like everything in the world, tired of;
But maybe this kind of
Sit under a deserted roof,
On a skinny and shaggy nag
Stars falling on the breg.
It's time to leave boring breg
Wearing glasses and a red wig.
About her, adjusting your wig,
The chieftain of the card gang,
Which Nazon sang,
So I, careless, sang
He, without ever reading,
Alas, Tatiana is fading,
The Girl was taken to the wedding.
Admiring the noisy crowding,
The big loss is not seeing
That the guests are coming. Suddenly seeing
Olga's smile is encouraging,
Unfortunately, Larina was dragging,
For the sake of appearance, the price list is hanging
Yes, glasses are ringing.
A rattling, continuous ringing
Your pensive singing?
The shepherd is still singing
And they were busy singing:
Burning with longing and longing,
Boredom and longing
He has a heart full of longing;
Or percy, full of longing;
Oh, nanny, nanny, I'm longing,
Her jealous longing,
I read with secret longing
It stretched to the south: it was approaching
What's your name? He's watching
Not without sighing,
My poor Lensky! languishing,
What, drearily languishing,
Suddenly the wind blew, extinguishing
He skips, blushing.
You did a noble thing.,
What brings you here? What a little thing!
(Which may be the same thing)
It is different to repeat one thing,
Keep thinking, thinking about one thing
On the cold panes breathing,
Barely breathing,
And laugh about something.
He was sick of it; nothing
The subject is worthy: nothing
So, Nanny, it's really nothing.
He doesn't understand anything,
He didn't notice anything.
Can't hide anything.
Through tears without seeing anything,
Not rejecting anything:
And we don't shine with anything,
Did they proclaim anything,
There is no joy for her anywhere, in anything,
He couldn't do anything.
Which is not sorry for anything,
I'm no good at anything.
And he doesn't say anything.
He's not embarrassed by anything,
Not reflected by anything;
A stranger to everyone, not bound by anything,
We are busy, we judge everything,
An angry gentleman for everything:
I will give you details about everything,
Onegin was silent about everything;
And it's all the same croaking,
And now the frosts are already cracking
Now friends are talking:
And I was attracted to thinking:
Tatiana loves without joking
But very good-looking;
Dogs rushed towards her, barking.
Then, in return for babbling,
Incorrect, careless babbling,
The sad moon is trembling
The other is slowly circling,
Obedient to the attraction of feeling,
He loved the method out of feeling,
Of course, he did not shine with any feeling,
Moscow kneeling
We were silently reveling!
Entered: and a cork in the ceiling,
Life was playing, blood was boiling,
Onegin, his eyes sparkling,
She forgot: she started calling
A block of snow is falling.
Here, to spite the spelling,
And dreams, and card fortune-telling,
Although people are unwilling
While the star was still rolling,
He stops the horse in front of him, pulling
The first snow is flickering, curling,
And everything, saying goodbye, was bustling
The frames were shaking and rattling;
He gets up from the table, rattling;
At least she was dazzling.
With the happy power of dreaming
A silent monument of dreaming,
It's like I'm dreaming
Tanya's eyes are streaming.
The spurs of the cavalry are strumming;
Ringing pitchers are coming;
The Prince is coming
The sorceress winter is coming.
The hour is coming.;
A dream that is sad, then charming
Dreams have a terrible meaning
Where he's going in the evening.
Three houses are calling for the evening:
Lensky was distracted all evening,
It was getting dark; on the table, shining,
The theater is already full; the boxes are shining;
And meanwhile the moon was shining
A magnificent house is shining;
Labors in vain without ruining,
The night shadows are already thinning
Whose head is not spinning,
Onegin, grinning,
Onegin, secretly grinning,
The schemes of a despicable cunning
What a low cunning
The fragrant tea was already running,
He's been playing since morning.
I wasn't surprised in the morning,
Pale as a shadow, dressed in the morning,
I have to be sure in the morning,
And he doesn't know himself in the morning,
Walking in the morning;
The day's ray will flash in the morning
And I read a book in the morning
She came back early in the morning
Always as cheerful as the morning,
Had Dozed off under her pillow until morning.
His life is ready until morning,
He leaves on a clear morning,
I am awake every morning
To have Faith every morning
Old chapters are burning.
My Tatiana's heart was burning!
Everything has calmed down. Tatiana is sleeping.
It's dark in the valley. The grove is sleeping
Poor Tatiana is not sleeping
Don't go peeping
That the mind, loving space, is cramping,
Barking, laughing, singing, whistling and clapping,
Blowing your nose, coughing, shushing, clapping;
Where Thalia is quietly napping
Don't go eavesdropping
But the spurs did not ring,
Tall, gentle, daring?
Women's leprosy swearing,
I started remembering
The other managed her suffering
Oh, who would mute her suffering
Love is crazy suffering
Provincial and simpering,
Friends and friendship are boring,
They slander even boring;
The higher tone is rather boring;
A different, old spring
There's a nightingale, a lover of spring,
Are my golden days of spring?
In the face of the blowing spring
It changes every spring.
They are both being updated and maturing
Women and coachmen are cursing.
(Fate, however, cursing),
Rousseau (I'll note in passing)
The deadline is also passing.
The windy youth is guessing,
Her doubts are confusing:
Chinese kettle heating;
Gulnara's singer imitating,
Onegin is quietly captivating
But the consequences of an unexpected meeting
But those who are in a friendly meeting
The one after the first greeting,
Still, having vegetated, the horses are fighting,
A high step was waiting.
That's when I'll start writing
The life of both of us was tormenting;
For a month, the mirror is pointing;
With children of all ages, counting
In careless bliss, not counting,
The lazy East is resting,
It felt like it was bursting.
That she is so trusting,
And he forbade forgetting!
And a long sitting.
A bearded postilion is sitting,
Forgotten bridges are rotting,
No one is listening, they are shouting,
There is no hope! He's leaving,
Where, why am I striving?
One breathing, one loving,
And enjoying without loving.
And it beats with a rainbow wing,
With a languid head bowing;
Noise, laughter, running, bowing,
Innocent conversations are flowing
The crimson ray of dawn is playing;
Now what kind of attention is she paying
The maiden's mirror is lying.
The legs of lovely ladies are flying;
Fiery eyes are flying,
A dashing caravan is flying;
They unwound my braid crying
Screaming: Yes, stop crying,
The old ladies hugged each other crying,
The pink wafer is drying
They didn 't stop worrying
In the good heat of moralizing,
They flowed quietly. The beetle was buzzing.
She didn't cry for long.
Get angry or drink, and the evening is long
The beauties didn't stay long
First of all, he was already wrong,
In this case, he is completely wrong.
A cherished song,
Tighten up the song,
Like a verse without a thought in a fashionable song,
The beauties of Olga the young,
Around the carriage of the young,
And the feelings and thoughts of the young,
Friends to quarrel with the young
Blessed is he who was young when he was young,
Alas! the bride is young
Her dove is young,
And the townswoman is young,
The Finnish singer is young!
Alas, the lover is young,
It's time between the wolf and the dog,
And for a long time, as if through a fog,
And now all minds are in a fog,
Where he wintered like a groundhog,
Ohtenka is in a hurry with the jug,
The stomach
It's in my stomach,
Alas, a well-deserved reproach!
A pleading look, a mute reproach,
And I hear your angry reproach.
Always an enthusiastic speech
I have to after a long speech
I don't like Russian speech.
Please notice my speech:
She is prone to counter-speech.
It stalled. There is no wreath on the branch;
The driver is sitting on a bench
And drops of tears, and on the bench
And, panting, onto the bench
And she got up from her bench;
Her on a rickety bench
Like a drunk, and the French
And Russian is like French
So, I wrote in French
Happy with the festive lunch,
Yes, after a boring lunch
Olenka jumped off the porch,
Or when driving on the porch
When everyone came out on the porch,
And onto the porch.
He flew, he's at the porch,
But since it's from the back porch
Not to the muses of this watch,
Forgive me: I love it so much
And I'm not attached to her much.;
The old lady loved it very much
A luxurious touch.
Rushes along the Neva River in a sleigh.
There's an icy corpse on the sleigh;
The sun is already rolling high,
Meanwhile, the goal of the ode is high
Neither a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
He'll laugh.
Or offends, or makes you laugh,
And I can't read enough.
He had fooled the light enough
Hunting the bonds of marriage are not enough,
Leaf by leaf sorting through,
On the leash,
She doesn't dare; she ran around in a flash
In a sheepskin coat, in a red sash.
In the rain of passions, they are fresh,
Our games are girlish.
To appear gloomy, to languish,
No matter how hard we fought, to distinguish.
One habitual wish,
She's coming towards me. How harsh!
Tolstoy with a miraculous brush
Elegies are a miserable wreath,
He was rocking a mysterious wreath.
Enough for us to follow one path
I ran across her path,
I am now embarking on a new path
Both for nails and teeth.
She said quietly through her teeth
Blessed is he a hundred times who is devoted to the faith,
But I've read Adam Smith.
Which he is alone with,
Steam is spinning, and warmth
Or, more gently, like a moth,
Women flash past the booth,
The winter road is smooth.
Everyday life of the earth:
It touches the earth!
In the grave, in the damp mother earth!
Who has no rebirth?
The breath froze in my mouth,
I tried to keep it in my mouth
I love the frenzied youth,
Let's forgive the fever of youth
And truffles, the luxury of youth,
My boiling youth
We were given youth,
Where is the eternal rhyme to her youth?
When is the rebellious youth
Like the sins of the past youth,
He is in his first youth
A friend of my youth,
With the betrayal of my youth
But also a fiery youth
Oh, my easy youth!
So, to tell you the truth,
It: And, full of living truth,
I am no longer capable of Ai;
Let me look around. Excuse me, seni,
Or a heavy dream break,
Or a satanic freak,
They laugh, argue and squeak.
It was simple: the floor was oak,
Chairs rattle as they are pushed back;
Flying, flying; take a look back
She, not daring to look back,
Will I go forward, will I go back?..
He starts on his way back.
And the curls are shoulder-length black.
She looks quietly through the crack,
That long bough of hers by the neck
Here is a skull on a goose neck
And the canopy expanded thick
She knows the trick,
Drank, ate, was bored, got fat, got sick,
There is a passionate heat in her; she is stuffy, sick;
Be brave, healthy, sick,
I looked at the sun, at the clock,
Yes droshky a distant knock
All the senses are suddenly struck.
As if thunderstruck.
A wet shoe will get stuck;
Leaning on his hand with his cheek.
At least rarely, at least once a week
You're invited to them next week.
She's ready to talk.
Still in a hurry to talk.
Crazy heart talk,
Sharpened the lily stalk;
In this tedious walk
They carried dishes according to rank.
Priests and guests ate and drank
But it's too late; it's time to go. It shrank
(Like a love dream, another prank)
But what did Tatiana think,
Oh my God! What did he think!
Her health is the first to drink
She should meet a black monk
Lying in bed with a book,
Vladimir closes the book,
One wanders with a dangerous book,
And this fifth notebook
Sensitive poems notebook
(See the first notebook)
Then with a question hook.
He will earn a favorable look
To look at you with a cheerful look!..
Tatiana with a tender look
Tatiana with a curious look
And Lensky pawns the rook
Everything in it is both quiet and dark;
Two of them are sitting in the dark;
Tatiana does not sleep in the dark
Where sad he left a mark.
A sharp nail mark;
What a thought, a remark
Getting rid of the wet cork,
And the thirst for knowledge and work,
It's time for warmth, flowers, and work,
I wanted to write, but it was hard work
Bless my long work,
She went to work,
What do you want, ask
Or someone else flaunts a mask,
With a stocking in his hand, a gray-haired Kalmyk.
Lunch is quite whimsical,
A heavy gossip, an old rascal,
His Ochakov medal!
On the buzzword ideal
The common people, the ideal,
And you, my faithful ideal,
Having found my former ideal,
Tatiana's sweet ideal
And the virgin of the mountains, my ideal,
To your desperate appeal?
And he wakes up Lensky with an appeal:
He has a tombstone madrigal.
Some kind of vulgar madrigal,
Her impulses are beneficial,
Instead of bristling like an animal;
To talk about Juvenal,
Some important general.
Hunters before the funeral.
Like at a big funeral;
And he gave the land as collateral.
Buyanov wooed: refusal.
Lepage's trunks are fatal
And the coffin secrets are fatal,
The thirst for food is fatal;
Your tempter is fatal.
And thoughts are dead capital
There was, however, the color of the capital,
And grandfather's faithful capital
But this passion is also accidental
The music will be regimental!
I'm through a magic crystal
Perfume in faceted crystal;
All the lots were equal
They have a fat carnival
Their unexpected arrival
To impress with your arrival;
The parquet cracked under his heel,
Who are you, my guardian angel,
Bullets go into the faceted barrel,
Sometimes it 's prudent to quarrel,
A miserable life of tinsel,
A short call, or a cartel:
By killing a friend in a duel,
Lensky called his friend to a duel.
They are rowing silver with a shovel;
By God, a scene from a novel
And the distance of a free novel
The gentle pages of the novel
A moral novel,
Who hasn't read her novel
At the beginning of our novel,
The hero of our novel!
Reading a sweet novel,
(And that's how I started my novel);
At the beginning of my novel
With the hero of my novel
For now, my novel
Everything is in Olga, but any novel
On the rumors about the misty novel,
Leave the restless hail,
They call two friends and put them in jail.
I galloped headlong through the mail
Or send congratulations by mail,
One, underneath, is gray-haired and frail
I spread my friends on the extreme trail,
A momentary thought, a long trail,
I will describe it to you in detail.
I read and read, but all to no avail:
The features of his pencil.
That in the Highest is destined to be the council
She leveled it with a plump veil;
Don't laugh at them until
Fruits of science, good and evil,
That stupidity is windy and evil,
In caps and roses, they look evil;
Fierce laughter rang wildly; the eyes of all,
Sometimes he won't notice at all:
At least it's not much use at all
You're not sick at all:
I am not worthy of them at all.
I've seen him, and I haven't seen him at all
Describe the St. Petersburg Ball;
What a joy: there will be a ball!
But, tired of the noise of the ball
He's going to bed from the ball:
Like Chatsky, from the ship to the ball.
We'd better hurry to the ball,
God forbid I get together at the ball
You don't have to come to the call.
They rise, mature and fall;
The sheets that died in the fall,
And that's what you expect to fall.
The overnight stay is taken away from the entrance hall
Here our hero drove up to the entrance hall;
Everything was shaking in the huge hall,
A whisper ran through the hall
She looks: forgotten in the hall
There was no bear; she was in the hall;
And he goes straight into the hall
And everyone poured out into the hall.
Suddenly, from behind the door in the long hall
Come to my golden hall!..
Take the keys from her hall;
Tatiana jumped into the other hall,
Fell
My student cell
It flies from the wax cell.
Above their eyebrows is the inscription of hell:
She didn't speak Russian well.,
Dear friend, you are not well.
When I was seriously ill,
And so Tatiana comes down the hill,
A village, a grove under the hill
He sat down, he's flying to the mill.
They have to go to the mill
With a living mind and will,
Involuntarily, or out of good will,
Now, I know, in your will
It's all settled: I'm at your will
Sometimes, the word of the lord's will
And a column with a cast-iron doll
And the color is pale and the appearance is dull;
Innocent charm is full,
The fate of Lensky is full;
And now he has become her idol
The spring of honor, our idol!
Mature young ladies idol,
He knew how to fool a fool
He was playing the fool.
There is a dressing gown and a cap on the cotton wool.
He really hit the ace with a pistol
Not this timid girl,
She seemed like a stranger to the girl.
Who would dare to look for a gentle girl
The eyes of an attentive girl
Play with a developed curl
No one could have made her beautiful
The storm blew, the color is beautiful
Yes, you're ready, beautiful!
And fascinating and harmful?
And they are so painful.
Have poets ever been tearful
That's wonderful.
Frisky, carefree, cheerful,
Slides and falls; cheerful
I could have been much less colorful
I'm sure being a soul,
The deception of an inexperienced soul!
The longing of a troubled soul?
Everything gives life to a languid soul
Eternal murmuring of the soul,
Fame for the baseness of the soul,
They pressed deep into the soul.
With his immoral soul,
I gave myself up with a full soul.
More worthy than a beautiful soul,
And the dreams of a thoughtful soul.
Tatiana (Russian soul,
That's enough! With a clear soul
And whatever confused her soul,
She doesn't move her soul.
Ulan is loved by her soul
And I managed to occupy her soul.
Tell me: with your soul
Alone with your soul
He wanders, and his soul
To the depths of his soul
He was immersed in his soul.
Pity was born in his soul:
He began to draw in his soul
The credulity of an innocent soul.
Tatiana is a greedy soul;
Before this frisky soul!..
I dreamed, and my soul
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
They disturb the sleep of my soul.
In the depths of my soul,
Thinking, my soul,
I am grateful with all my soul
Fields! I am devoted to you with all my soul.
Your voice sounded in my soul
Not only sadness, my soul,
I will not renew my soul
Don't be angry, my soul,
You are a pure, fiery soul,
She sang for the guests over the bowl,
I am.
That's what a fool I am!
But that's the moonbeam
And the boy served cream;
There was an unbearable scream
Rushing, he wants to scream:
Meets the morning of the year through a dream;
But Tanya, just like in a dream,
She's stuffy here, she's a dream
Not for a long time, it wasn't a dream!
That girl, or is it a dream?..
She is disturbed by a dream.
So we were carried away by a dream
In the midst of a poetic dream
Like in a terrible, incomprehensible dream,
Always, everywhere there is one dream,
And Onegin is with her in a vague dream
Keeps the hopes of a dark dream;
And Tatiana has a wonderful dream.
And does he believe in his chosen dream?
Impulses of a virgin dream
Who did you see in your dream?
He amused himself with a sweet dream
And a hot lonely dream,
But, amused by an empty dream,
It tormented her like a heavy dream.
Now it's a hillock, then a stream
It's getting clearer through the steam. There's a stream
His magic stream
I crossed the stream;
Put through the stream;
Flying through the flower beds to the stream.
Tatiana grumbles at the stream;
By the old lime trees, by the stream;
A barely noticeable stream
Through the cups with a dark stream
But the opinions of the secular stream
The murmur of a quiet stream;
Interprets Sey and Bentham,
It is with its play and foam
And the horses are fighting, white foam
But it changes with a noisy foam
It would be suitable in an epigram)
A pleasantly cheeky epigram
This Hellespont swam,
Where should I read them?
Yes, Olga did not read them.
All the same: I haven't changed them
And generally despised them,
After that, the muse revived them:
And finally I got behind them;
Let's go to them; you will oblige them;
Can I imagine them
In order to have breakfast with the three of them,
I found a notebook in one of them.,
He had suffered enough of them.
Malice awaited both of them
There are different chains on all of them;
But it's really close. In front of them
And the door opened in front of them,
Although I didn't understand a lot of them,
Trickles writhed beneath them
And, I admit, I ran away from them,
And she went wild between them,
But there is no change in them;
Other lines. He's in them.
And he played only chords on them,
Because I belong to them.
Their household will hear them,
What kind of nets I prepared for them!
The door opens wide for them,
At first she had no time for them,
And still: hope for them
In addition, taking more for them
Inspiring love is a disaster for them,
Scaring people is a joy for them.
They sound and flow. He reads them
But the ringing of the breguet brings them,
We have to caress them,
You can't even show your nose at them.
Madman, will you forget them?
About Christmas to visit them
Onegin talked about them
I often told her about them.
Others follow them
Blessed is the one who did not know them,
But I don't want to fix them.
No songs inspired by them:
Nothing touched him,
And when he went down to the coffin, he blessed him.
At first Madame followed him,
His father couldn't understand him
Olenka yawned behind him,
He hears the bear behind him,
He looks at everything around him,
She doesn't notice him.,
At first, everyone went to see him;
She won't see him.;
They were full of flowers and bloomed before him
She must hate him.
And they will only infuriate him.
And without taking my eyes off him,
He sees Olga in front of him.
And there was a fireplace burning in front of him,
Faces flash in front of him
Trike stands up; the assembly is in front of him
Dared to clean his nails in front of him,
Walking, walking. And suddenly in front of him
They don't see him, not a word with him;
You were friends with him.:
Everyone stopped being friends with him.
And Onegin is with him.
Yes, there are two or three more novels with him,
You must connect with him,
And we got it from him.
The souls have not changed in him,
Nothing was spared in him:
The soul was ignited in him;
A sad heart does not sleep in him:
Not respecting the heart in him,
And I would be glad to say goodbye to him.
And travel to him,
My soul is alien to him;
They bring notes to him.
Two days seemed new to him
Just so you can hear him).
And she was running after him,
There is also a dream flying over him.
I've already chosen him over him.
I was captivated: for him
What was the difference for him
Lunch won't ring for him.
In a moment that was evil for him,
The purpose of our life is for him
She said: It's him!
But one thought surrounds him;
The Princess looks at him
Where Tatiana met him.
He woke up; they brought him
Do you speak about him?
Lord Byron by a lucky whim
She likes the order slim
And a young pilgrim
Lensky fell an unfortunate victim
It is extremely durable and calm
A fan of fame and freedom,
For sweet bliss and freedom:
His abominable freedom
Forgive me, too, my freedom!
All sons of greedy boredom.
I go everywhere at random;
Don't let me wander off at random.
At least casually, at least at random;
Into whom?
Handsome, in full bloom,
He looks, it's already light in the room;
They lay down on chairs in the dining room,
Scream meets them in the living room
Everything calmed down: in the living room
There is a meeting of new faces in the living room,
There are damask wallpapers in the living room,
The crowd is pouring into the living room:
Accustomed to her room.
The legislator's room?
He settled in that room,
Tatiana is expecting a groom;
He was accepted everywhere as a groom;
And he came out of the bathroom
And he couldn't. She asked if he had been here long, where he came from
This is the village custom;
I left it without finishing it to the bottom
Tatiana by her charm.
She is sweet with careless charm,
Well? I found a secret charm
With what lively charm
But only with a sleepy charm
There is a crush in the hall, an alarm;
He was supposed to disarm
In it, the thoughts were outraged by a swarm;
Desires are a self-willed swarm.
Their comedies are a noisy swarm,
Where there are two more in uniform
I remember the sea before the storm:
Everyone is covered in a snowstorm,
Hedgehog, darkness, bridge, bear, snowstorm
And a migratory snowstorm
He searched for them without enthusiasm,
I saluted classicism:
(What do we call romanticism,
Clothed in a dull romanticism
The idea of rural witticism!)
Poems of the Russian mechanism
And for sure: by the power of magnetism
In Olga Molodoy's album;
County young ladies album,
In those days when in the gardens of the Lyceum
And young fever and young delirium.
Leaving a cup of tea with rum,
Already awakened by the drum.
I wanted to like Alban
I didn't explain myself in Russian,
Isn't everything in Russian
All these words are not in Russian;
With the young Venetian,
I was already thinking about the form of the plan
It wasn't part of her plan,
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
He looks like a dead man.
And an incredulous old man,
And stretch the man
Onegin is in a hurry to see the young man,
Lure the young man
He listened diligently to the young man.
And the modern man
And even an honest man:
He was a simple and kind gentleman,
The Lord's slave and foreman,
Monseur Abbe, a poor Frenchman,
The less we love a woman,
Lensky replied to the old woman,
He shot past the doorman
But from a shaggy footman
I'll at least give you a loan.
His handlebars made the first moan.
In glasses, in a tattered caftan,
Singer Giaur and Juan
In the spring, with the clicks of the swan,
From the Millionth there was a sudden;
And a maiden
In the hut, singing, the maiden
Everything is clear to her. A simple maiden,
Sorry, the games are golden!
And he took me for a walk in the Summer Garden.
A huge, neglected garden,
For a shelf of books, for a wild garden,
Let's go home around the garden;
Now we're going to fly to the garden,
From the porch to the yard, and straight into the garden,
I'll take a look at the house, at this garden.
And here she is in my garden
He looks at the empty garden
To harden, to harden,
The conditions of light overthrowing the burden,
Quite. Off with the burden!
How long has it been?
It's like they're turning green.
Fooling around; at the age of eighteen
A philosopher at the age of eighteen.
Almost at the age of eighteen.
A girl at the age of thirteen!
With a soul straight from Gottingen,
His father died then.
And it crumbled, then
We will torment the heart, and then
Say a word to you, and then
For a few days she then
Were you in love then?
Onegin, I was younger then,
Two minutes later, then
Then they liked it; then
The inscription says to the alien:
From the mouth of Onegin. Sullen,
I was angry, he was sullen;
On the plane of the ladies, on the tone of the men,
Epicureans are wise men,
And the dark frame of men
So unapproachable for men,
The owner of the poor men;
Merchants, hovels, men,
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Write odes, gentlemen,
He sings about the Volga fishermen;
More tired footmen
Meanwhile, we, the enemies of Hymen,
The subject of both thoughts and pen,
Yawning, he took up the pen,
Or Baratynsky's pen,
It did not come out of his pen,
And there he walks in the open,
The green tables are open:
The shutters are open;
Eugene pushed the door open:
Withered still half-open.
And crowns were predicted for the children
The child herself, in a crowd of children
B died in the midst of children,
Wet nurses cry and cry of children.
And teaches the alphabet to children.
To a voice known by children:
A useful trade having chosen,
Come to my corner more often,
I talk about feasts just as often,
The sun shone less often,
Tatiana wants to listen
The light and the noisy ball are forgotten,
Billiards is abandoned, the cue is forgotten,
An abandoned cart is forgotten.
Perhaps by the will of heaven,
But brighter than all the friends of heaven
The watch of the distant vault of heaven,
That she is gifted from heaven
The creation of hell or heaven,
I wish I could bless heaven.
So it is clearly destined by heaven.
It's time to get up: it's past seven.
Husbands of the military and the campaign.
And in their mouths the language is foreign
He will give a sign
Hunting to rule is a sign,
And, it is deeply immersed in,
The new landowner rode in
He's on his way; just let him in
What's wrong with him? What a strange dream he's in!
And lighter than a swallow, it flies in;
He's calling as soon as possible. Runs in
He examined it, then put it in
Whispered again
Dressed, undressed and dressed again?
He'll wake up in the afternoon, and again
He won't wait for the day to end again.
I'm free, I'm looking for an alliance again
Why are you turning pale again?
Then he started talking again
Imagination is boiling again,
Her touch again
Onegin is counting the clock again,
Now silent, now cheerful again;
Onegin (I'll take care of him again),
Onegin, we are being driven by boredom again,
And, full of inspiration again,
There is no answer. He's a messenger again:
He continues the waltz with her again;
Now she's resurrected in her again.
They were able to attract her again
A young lover again
Annoyance? vanity? or again
I would connect my friends again!
Will I hear your choirs again?
Sensitive, careless again,
What to do! I repeat again:
And day and night until we meet again.
He renounced the light again.
There are three bottles on loan to drain.
Although I could find a grain.
The wagons are loaded with a mountain,
Protected from the winds by a mountain,
The moon has disappeared behind the mountain,
To the river running under the mountain;
Under the silk curtain
Napoleon waited in vain,
And I'm wasting my time in vain
Your perfections are in vain:
My gaze catches him in vain,
He looks, he calls him in vain:
But it's sad to think that it's in vain
Waiting for us behind the coffin.
And the great-grandfathers are crowding towards the coffin.
He needs to prepare an honest coffin
They merged into one Onegin.
Tatiana's letter to Onegin
Everything was new to Onegin;
The Prince looks at Onegin.
And he looks at Onegin
As I am with my Onegin.
Like the thoughts of a simple-minded virgin,
Everything is full of them; everything is sweet to the virgin
You shifted the passionate virgin
Or letters from a young virgin.
Saying goodbye to the young virgin,
And something pale and thin,
With the keys of the old Kremlin:
The Humble Sinner, Dmitry Larin,
Yes, I remembered, though not without sin,
Joking, judging is not without sin,
For how long? Honey! Cousin!
Her Moscow cousin,
He knew quite a lot of Latin.,
The mind and passion to win,
Between two aunts at the column,
The sky was breathing in autumn,
Like leaves rotten in autumn.
I put bee Tatana on.
Tatiana silently leaned on,
(A punishment based on,
And that's what the world is spinning on!
You're the one I've been drunk on!
Guess after guess went on.
She liked novels early on;
They are harnessed to the boyar wagon,
And he answers: Agathon.
By the proud lyre of Albion
Of course it is. But the whirlwind of fashion,
Is to get behind the run-down fashion.
Fluff her curls according to fashion
Cut in the latest fashion,
About the news of the city, about fashion
He needs a Don stallion,
And he's calling her to the cotillion.
And the endless cotillion
Forgive me, my strange companion,
And here is the public opinion!
But I fell behind their union
Isn't that you, sweet vision,
I would prefer an offensive passion.
No, never a rush of passion
Sad is the dead trail of passion:
Having no high passion
There was a science of tender passion,
No, more than a joyless passion
Feeding the heat of the purest passion,
They are not worth any passion,
Where, where is the confusion, compassion?
Decayed in a quick succession,
The rings come out in succession;
The soul of a trusting confession,
How, the hearts of a loving confession,
Her heartfelt confession
Accept my confession:
But first he asks for permission
I could see Tanya's confusion;
Poetry is a sacred delusion,
Tatiana sees with trepidation,
He enters the Princess with trepidation;
This is a profound creation
A newborn creation,
Separation, tears of reconciliation,
Incomplete, weak translation,
Not a ball of speculation,
Modern (by calculation
Killed!.. With this terrible exclamation
Zaretsky stood up without explanation;
In jealous indignation
To amuse the imagination
It's been a long time since her imagination,
And in front of him is imagination
A rebellious imagination,
Excite my imagination,
He hears their speeches without participation,
How often in a sad separation,
No long summers of separation,
Like an annoying separation,
Who cooled love by separation,
The instant harvest of a generation,
Where is the noble aspiration
Whose gaze, stirring inspiration,
And you, the younger inspiration,
Will he rise, immediately the conversation
The poet's passionate conversation,
The great charm of conversation.
Jam, eternal conversation
Into conversations, into a general conversation;
Have a calm conversation,
Without compulsion in conversation
A cold, stern conversation,
But in general their conversation
The heroes of our conversation:
He ran away from their noisy conversation.
Sparkled without silly affectation,
Blessed is He who has known their agitation
What about him? Is it imitation,
There is a tavern at each station.
God grant his soul salvation,
Boiling in empty action.
He takes his own in distraction.
I looked at it in great distraction,
As a model of perfection.
May the world believe in perfection;
Your soul is all your perfection,
Taking the young lady under his protection.
Although it's late, there is an introduction.
Poems without measure, according to tradition
Beg and demand recognition,
The other attracted her attention,
He looks at me with sweet emotion;
With what heavy emotion
To sighs, boredom and deception
Drinking a seductive deception!
She knows no deception
And there is also a sad inscription
He's not suffering from consumption.
The fourth year of the patient in consumption,
I often hear the question:
That was Olenka's first question.
So! indifferent oblivion
How he crumbled like a small demon!
This angel, this arrogant demon,
I'm going to be possessed by a new demon,
Or even my demon.
A glutton, a bribe taker and a buffoon.
Some kind of sad buffoon
Like a majestic moon,
With a clouded moon,
Like this stupid moon
And the night, and the stars, and the moon,
Like a baby's dream, like the moon
The younger two-horned face of the moon
And the predictions of the moon.
Languid eyes are raised to the moon,
Tatiana, looking at the moon
About a wonderful night, about the moon
Under the inspiring moon.
That I'll see you in the afternoon
Yes, move the table; I'll go to bed soon;
Oh, I will, I will! And soon
The opening is big soon
Let's have lunch soon!
I've accepted the receptions soon!
Or is it time for tears soon?
Am I going to be thirty soon?
He recently married his son.
I remembered them for a reason.
They told me to call, and there is no reason
Send your grandson.
So, let's go quietly grandson
She loved Richardson.
I'm crazy about Richardson.
And the incomparable Grandison,
Not because Grandison
How, Grandison?.. Ah, Grandison!
Cousin, do you remember Grandison?
It certainly wasn't Grandison.
They send him to the waters in unison.
How to get into the green forest from prison
You can be a good person
N. N. is a wonderful person.
Although he is an unknown person,
Did I hear your lesson?
He was caught like a simpleton.
No gossip of the world, no Boston,
He doesn't drive the cows out of the barn,
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
It's a wonderfully molded pattern
Everything in them is based on the old pattern:
The head of the rakes, the tribune of the tavern,
Where maybe you were born
Silvered; there's a horn
They are not called by his horn;
Above this humble urn
To shed a tear over an early urn
Tell me: how did he return?
Or, not happy about the return
Sick and fondling and fun
An indifferent spectator of fun,
But sweeter, in the midst of nocturnal fun,
He shared her fun,
Invents for fun,
Sang of children's fun,
What kind of malicious fun,
But this is important fun
Turning away from the gun.
And everyone took their own gun.
Well, if your gun
Tatiana tries to run:
Sparkling in the sun,
She does not notice the dawn,
Withered at the dawn,
Arrive tomorrow before dawn,
And finally before dawn,
Sweetly on the beam of dawn
Curtains, bridges, lawn,
All the daughters were expecting their own
Not on the post office, on their own,
He believed that his soul was his own
But so be it: I'm on my own
Will I see you?.. And the stream came down
The light shirt came down
Don't let the poet's soul cool down,
My soul will completely calm down:
Grunting, the obnoxious bear falls down;
It oozed and immediately put it down
The singer is forced to sit down;
And he ate and drank in his dressing gown;
When would Tatiana have known,
When would she have known,
Will flash and not: it is known,
She is shamefacedly under the crown
And he took a new crown.
An old man with a lot to do,
Or is he also acting like a weirdo?
My uncorrected weirdo.
To be known as a fake weirdo,
That he's a dangerous weirdo.
Where is this cloudy weirdo,
I didn 't give the sweet habit a go;
I thought: maybe it will go;
She watched them go
Goodbye, Onegin, I have to go.
Where will my prankster go?
Let's go.
Vladimir said. And let's go
No, my Moscow didn't go
How Tanya has grown up! A long time ago
About Lensky's wedding a long time ago
Even though I looked in a long time ago
Here's the morning: everyone got up a long time ago,
It would have been time to find it long ago,
Who would have thought? How long ago!
One moment ago
Chu virgo
Sing God knows who,
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
Yes and no.
I used to walk there too:
I must admit, I am glad to write too,
And he respected that feeling too.
Vice is amiable in the novel too,
But I'm tired of Didlo too.
Who inspired her with this tenderness too,
Ivan Petushkov too.
And I haven't read Cicero,
Always an enthusiastic hero
And what will I call the hero;
He brought us to our hero
He showed us his hero
A letter for a sweet hero
An impatient hero.
I love my hero,
And here is my hero,
Saying goodbye to bars. And so
How will it go, and tomorrow also,
So, my noon has come, and I need to
Which he silently agreed to.
Which I am now unaccustomed to.
What is it about, Tanya? I used to,
But I think I would like to
Isn't that right, friend? Not at all. Where to!
Or a girl's! We all have to
It flows so quietly, so according to
To the neighbor and tell him to,
To call Moina (in order to,
A diligent ear readily tends to
They rushed over. He tells the servant to
Stubborn mouths want to!
Boiling Lensky did not want to
Allow me: maybe you want to
He gives me his n-quarto,
And he also eats and drinks for two.
I didn't trust the treacherous two.
Or with an academician in a cap!
The same tulle cap;
Or a sad madcap,
An eloquent madcap.
Then they induced sleep;
All good things: vigils and sleep
He is disturbed by his late sleep.
He sits down in an ice bath from sleep,
And Olga is all wrapped up in sleep.
One went home to sleep.
And gradually put to sleep
And what? Just like that. I'm putting you to sleep
Walking, reading, deep sleep,
And into a sweet, sinless sleep
What about my Onegin? Half asleep
They don't give you a minute to fall asleep;
Hurriedly accelerates her step;
And he puts it on the doorstep.
Noise, laughter, crush at the doorstep,
Is more reliable than friendship and kinship:
He brought the fruits of scholarship:
I will pay my debt to censorship
Zaretsky bit his lip.
Under it (as it starts to drip
And a table with a dimmed lamp,
The moon, the heavenly lamp,
Or Melmoth, the gloomy tramp,
A meadow is turned into a swamp
I didn't want to play or jump
Yes, they took me to church with a stump.
It's still cocked. For the near stump
And he did not get into the perky workshop
Boston and the Old Men's Pawnshop,
Then the camp will develop, then it will develop
Human rumor and horse top!
Tatiana will sigh, then gasp;
And the dark mind cleared up.
And Tatiana's husband showed up,
He finally woke up
Then a villainous rhyme came up.
The extinguished ashes will no longer flare up,
Now I'm ready to give up.
His fiancee gave herself up.
The dances were already breaking up;
He's gradually stiffening up,
The reins are fluffy blowing up,
Someday it will light us up
It's time, my child, get up:
She doesn't pick it up
Or the handkerchief will lift it up.
The slow Summer will swallow you up,
Tanya asked. Hurry up
But come on. I need to hurry up
Into the fields, friends! Hurry up, hurry up,
It goes down the pipe. Light Cup
A big, disheveled bear;
Her confidante is dear,
He was an ignoramus at heart, dear,
I feel sick, my dear:
To whom, my dear?
To disturb you, my dear:
I freeze with shame and fear
I cried bitterly out of fear,
Not knowing what to start with fear,
Read in Russian. Really, fear!
Prayers, vows, imaginary fear,
Poetry is alive and clear,
He's the boss there, that's clear:
And his song was clear,
The night is frosty, the whole sky is clear;
You know, I'm not clear
A simple inscription and a tear
He shone with an obedient tear!
In such a year, such a year.
So that the rest of the year
And the calendar of the eighth year:
And they were promised every year
And, having forgotten the capital of the far
What will he present to us so far?
Relatives who arrived from afar,
As we see from afar,
Suddenly seeing from afar
Or having known it from afar
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
In the attic, born a liar
I caught it, took it by the collar
His beaver collar.
It will teach us grammar;
Then they bring a guitar:
And now with him before the altar
When is a shooting star
Wearing a wide bolivar,
The neighbor is called to the samovar,
On the lies of magazines, on the war,
He's probably not nicer.
But whatever it is, the reader,
To the mocking reader
My dear reader!
And you, the benevolent reader,
You will agree, my reader,
Allow me, my reader,
Or shone, my reader;
Whoever you are, oh my reader,
Here's a cancer riding a spider,
Fluffy boa on the shoulder,
She leaned her head to his shoulder,
From her lovely shoulder
That there is no despicable slander,
Elaborate slander,
With the embellishment of light slander.
They are in a hurry to appear, to thunder,
Even scarier, even weirder:
And they sang in chorus according to the order
Finds it in alphabetical order
To establish a new order.
Her heart speaks louder.
And more trembling than a hunted deer,
But if morals didn't suffer,
Here is our Onegin, a villager,
The shepherd wakes up the villager.
A trumpet, a disguise and a dagger,
Barely remembering their love and anger.
Here is a large salt of secular anger
Listen to me without anger:
Without surprise, without anger
Between roast and blanc manger,
The minx has already frozen his finger:
She wrote with a lovely finger
He is no longer there. The younger singer
To meet the poor singer
Her passion burns stronger,
But nothing changed her:
An important general is behind her.
Yesterday to remind her;
Ulan knew how to captivate her,
I didn't dare to believe her:
Don't you forgive her
Meanwhile, he doesn't take his eyes off her
A splinter crackles in front of her.
An unfamiliar yard is in front of her,
In the snowdrifts in front of her
Into the alley, right in front of her,
Keeps talking about him. Bothering her
Blessed is he who has combined with her
The general who entered with her.
To go without sharing with her
I didn't have a conversation with her.
He wanted to start a conversation with her
Perhaps she took it with her
He approaches Olga. Quickly with her
Only Tanya's heart is not happy with her.
I am forever separated from her.
After all, Olenka is younger than her.
Suddenly it dawned on me: the muse is in her
She looks and the heart is in her
No one could have found it in her
Everything was quiet, it was just in her,
There is not a drop of coquetry in her
Vyazemsky somehow got hooked on her
Everything is quiet. The moon is shining on her.
The door opened. Olga to her,
To where he appeared to her.
And each one whispered to her:
It's for the evening. God! to her!..
The anthem of the times does not come to her,
And he passes the verse to her.
And he's insensitive to her
And I boldly entrust myself to her
And everything seems dark to her?
That was an unmistakable sign to her,
And another world opened up to her.
But Onegin came up to her
For the songs of the steppe, dear to her
The desire of the heart to whisper to her.
They whisper to her:
The ladies moved closer to her;
And everything seems priceless to her,
And importantly repeats to her
Everything points to her,
All objects are mysterious to her
Something wonderful says to her;
From that side, I would have given it to her;
The old lady to her:
Did not apply to her
And, bending down, he whispers softly to her
Someone who is sweet and scary to her,
Went and what? The bear is after her!
She lay down. Lel is hovering over her,
They replaced everything for her;
And is there really no return for her?
And a ring came out for her
He's preparing an elegy for her.
But a sinister dream promises her
In all her sorrows , he gives her
To his wife and brings her
Nothing interests her,
She runs, he follows her,
Tatiana goes into the forest; the bear follows her;
The old ladies smiled at her;
He's happy if he throws it at her
And where the conversation is about her.
How the state gets richer,
Or some publisher
And the cute floor is light as a feather.
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
That year, the autumn weather
She didn't even press her lips together.
Let's go to rest together
But there is no friendship between us either.
More sincere than the other.
There's a whole line of liqueurs in the other,
Disappointed by the other,
They were boring each other.;
They are not so different from each other.
Pull the trigger on each other
The sentries called to each other,
The aunts blinked at each other
On Saturday. Olenka and mother
To his father, not to his mother;
And a virtuous mother.
She sighed for another,
I love you with the love of a brother
The murderer of his brother;
Buyanov, my perky brother,
And she is too lazy to step further.
And put them on the barrier,
Head profiles flicker
The ghost is a vain seeker,
He's angry, he's a gossip, he's a talker
And, the morning moon is paler
Zaretsky, once a brawler,
Everything for a gentle dreamer
A poet, a thoughtful dreamer,
My sweet dreamer,
Where is the village old-timer
The Russian is treated with a hammer
Maybe it won't sink in the Summer
He got up at seven o'clock in the summer
But our northern summer,
But there are also traces of Tatiana the former
I have no hopes for the former,
When will we run to the banner
He died an hour before dinner,
But it's over. They're coming for dinner.
To a secluded corner,
The girls are whispering in the corner;
When there was one sitting in the corner,
The soul is a tragedy in the corner,
And locked it in a dark corner.
But he sulked in his corner,
There was a lovely corner;
A reliable friend, a peaceful landowner
Tatiana said goodbye to the housekeeper
To break the vessel of the slanderer;
Why did he end up a sufferer
A fickle admirer
We bring the confused duma closer
It was evening. The sky was fading. Water
Onegin flew to the theater,
Martin Zadeka became later
He was cheerful. Two weeks later
Cast-iron bridges across the water
Jugs of apple water
From a dish full of water,
Push the mountains apart, under water
Let me sprinkle with holy water,
A jug of cranberry water.
I'm afraid: lingonberry water
You are also, mothers, stricter
The girls were quieter
Petrarch marching after,
And that one, but we'll tell you everything after,
The sensible husband left soon after
Not an ardent boy, a fighter,
An old woman saying goodbye to her daughter,
What a secret tom my daughter
She was also bored by the ringing laughter,
Suppressing yawns with laughter:
They're laughing. The guests enter.
That the sight of them gives birth to a splinter.
And you'll have a nice winter.
I had lunch with him here in the winter
Salted mushrooms for the winter,
She will not go to meet the winter,
Cold, clean, like winter,
Enough for one winter,
I loved the Russian winter,
A stream that is not constrained in winter;
Until recently, I lived in winter
Where did you have fun in winter;
To go to Moscow in winter.
Nature was waiting for winter.
The coolness of the gloomy winter,
Into the bushes of the fallen shooter.
I have finished the first chapter;
Or an insidious tempter:
I will not tolerate a corrupter
It's time for me to become smarter,
Make acquaintance shorter.
The day was getting shorter,
Order is an enemy and a waster,
To take care of the older sister.
He was always afraid that the prankster
Captured by a schoolboy prankster;
And met by Vesper the rooster;
And, come on, friend; does it really matter?
I think I was better.,
And then everything started to get better.
The second, the third letter
You see, the case of the letter
And for the delivery of the letter.
And he doesn't press the letter
He's reading some kind of letter
Have to translate Tatiana's letter.
And in a thoughtless letter
Still a heart flutter
Oh fear! No, it's better and truer
And that their hand will not waver
Superbly subtle and clever,
It has been silenced forever.
Give up hope forever.
I will be faithful to him forever.
He was born on the banks of the Neva River,
And quietly tears are pouring down like a river,
Elegies flow like a river.
It was already burning, smoking, across the river
Above the nameless river
Brega with a motionless river
And a garden over a bright river.
I was floating on a dormant river:
Above the misty river;
Trees in winter silver,
What feeling will take over,
Bad magazine going over,
Sits down; the game is over:
Au is like a lover
And right away, blessed is the humble lover
Julia Volmar's lover,
The men bowed lower,
To have a two-morning flower
Into a spring sunken flower;
If only I had the power,
But will and reason are the power
Incessantly with magical power
Vladimir has no power
Oh, there is no power
Gone from their rebellious power,
Tatiana is waiting: when is the answer?
An immodest look, or an answer,
But the day has passed, and there is no answer.
He defiles the courteous answer.
I'm afraid: in my humble prayer
Or she delighted me with prayer
They needed kvass like air,
Onegin listened with an important air,
To Moscow, to the bride fair!
And loose hair,
Then he puts her on a chair,
Or the Eternal Jew, or the Corsair,
And the captives of the shores of Salgir.
How are you, divine Omir,
Heavenly luminaries wondrous choir
Everything is yes, yes, no; he will not say yes, sir
A glass, an offering to a neighbor,
He forgot himself, the neighbor
The neighbor sniffs in front of the neighbor;
His calculating neighbor;
For a semi-Russian neighbor;
She couldn't outshine her neighbor,
The late Lensky, our neighbor.
Mourned by his neighbor,
Does he speak to the Spanish ambassador?
And to me, Onegin, this splendor,
What are we being caressed by the yard for?
Who is your lyre sighing for?
That's me. And that's what they were looking for
The one she sighs for
Tatiana! Who is it for?
He thinks: I will be her savior.
It was only covered with a mortal pallor
The valleys dry up and are full of color;
The loss of life is the best color.
French cuisine is the best color,
Away from the fuss of rumor,
But I'm on bail, Your Honor.,
The newest Regulus, the god of honor,
Would you like a tempting honor?
It's strange to her. I have devoted myself to honor
And it is unlikely to be in his honor.
And pride and direct honor.
And then secretly dishonor
There is a scream and the clink of a glass outside the door,
But, quietly unlocking the door,
Everyone stood up: he was going to the door.
And he looks furtively at the door.
And leaning against the door,
In front of the spouse of the coffin door,
One foot touching the floor,
Caught unexpectedly by the floor,
There is a hall on the mirrored parquet floor,
When I helped the poor
Without a grammatical error
Involuntarily he looks in the mirror
But there is one in the dark mirror
And, I think, I read with horror
And Tanya woke up in horror
In fluff, in a cap with a visor
He used to be a fiery creator
The theater is an evil legislator,
Let's go, do me a favor!
Ready to do us a favor
With the scholarly air of a connoisseur
And our grandchildren in a good hour
And they're bringing tea. I love the hour
Without preface, this is the hour
I don't blame: in that terrible hour
Awakened at the usual hour
Onegin, do you remember that hour,
To burn with reason every hour
That they cheated on her every hour,
I'm ready to break out every hour.
Jealous without worrying about the flour,
And Werther, the rebellious martyr,
At Pelageya Nikolaevna's
That girl he's
For a long time forever. It's
I met Tanya at the boring aunt's,
He was already opening his vasisdas.
Without elegiac ideas
And harmonic ideas
Without imitative ideas
She opened a feast of young ideas,
Rural freedom has
When a simple product has.
Under the canopy of cherry trees and acacias
Ah, brothers! How pleased I was,
How languidly silent he was,
No matter how strong she was
If only he knew what kind of wound it was
Well, exactly the same as it was.
Here I did not look for careless stanzas,
Heeding the singing of mellifluous stanzas,
I read the first stanzas
What am I talking about in my stanzas
A reasonable sense without vulgar topics,
Without these little antics,
No female legs, no heads;
She kept expenses, shaved foreheads,
The tombstone reads:
Grammar, two Petriads
The shelter of thoughtful dryads.
A meal, thoughts and deeds
Kissing the mouths of the younger Armids,
There is no road; bushes, rapids
Secluded fields,
And they are silvered in the middle of the fields
Or a fast hare between the fields
Like storms in the fields:
Fog lay on the fields,
Now she's in a hurry to go to the fields
Spring rain on the grain fields)
She does not distinguish her fields:
A hymn of praise to the father of the worlds.
But you, blessed husbands,
And the friendship of hard husbands!
Kiss her, gently shake her hands,
Tatiana did not take it in her hands;
They scold the gentlemen and beat them in the palm of their hands
With a French book in his hands.
And I feel the leg in my hands;
Factories, waters, forests, lands
In the spring on the grasslands,
Tatiana believed in the legends
Those were secret legends
People are sacred friends;
She's like with old friends.,
Forgetting the city, and friends,
Have an easy life, friends!
All her little friends,
Inconsiderate friends,
A sweet conversation of friends.
And I was proud among friends
There's nothing to do, friends.
She greets two friends
I'm swimming, dear friends!
Dear friends, dear friends,
Today, dear friends,
Lovely, dear friends!
I used to give the last poor mite. Do you remember, friends?
But God save us from our friends!
It's nicer if he's friends,
His enemies, his friends
It all meant, friends:
In such an album, my friends,
These are my friends, my friends!
Now from you, my friends,
And brushes of thirty kinds
And her voice sounds
And I forgot the speech of the gods
Tatiana in the silence of the woods
We slide along the lacquer boards.
Onegin opened the cupboards;
A gambler and a sergeant of the guards.
Slanderers, and evil cowards,
I didn 't repeat it godlessly afterwards,
Trembling, unable to find words,
When visiting with him, he says three words,
Who are all the movements, all the words
Is there a full vocabulary of fashionable words?..
Foreign words.
In foreign words,
They prevailed. She has two words
Tableaux vivants, or sharp words,
And pour out sharp words,
At the cost of his funny words,
Turning around, without unnecessary words
Here's the north, catching up with the clouds,
I forgot what I knew. Yes,
The blessing of the tribes.
I visited the wandering tribes,
Not smiling faces;
Although there are no streets or palaces,
What stupid places!
I hear there are a lot of idle places.
Hunting for a change of places
They were changing places;
Sorry, peaceful places!
Double windows, fireplaces
You didn't leave any traces:
And age-old prejudices,
He found a yard full of services;
Sometimes difficult services
I will offer you my services;
And silently exchanged glances
Attract mocking glances!..
What did he know more firmly than all the sciences,
Double lorgnette obliquely induces
And the circle of despicable comrades,
And proud ladies she glides;
A fan of peaceful aonides,
Secret sleigh rides;
The mouth is chewing. From all sides
To the deceased from all sides
He bowed to the men from all sides,
And isn't it one of their sides?
Vladimir would write odes,
Some solemn odes!
Neither moths nor bees.
The snow is loose up to her knees;
To want to hug your knees
And the nightingale in the darkness of the trees
Suddenly, there is a squalid hut between the trees;
But in the cities, in the villages
How! From the wilderness of steppe villages
The lords of the neighboring villages
Meanwhile, two, three pages
We kept many pages
The head of the Chaldean sages,
The four mortal stages.
So you are inspired by Languages,
For sparse, strange languages,
In the maid's garden, on the ridges,
(resolute and strict judges)
According to the stories of young moustaches,
The flashing of dresses and speeches,
At least the sound of the speeches
I will retell simple speeches
And the sounds of gentle speeches,
And a belated warehouse of speeches;
Inaccurate pronunciation of speeches
In the fruitless dryness of speeches,
Who measures all deeds, all speeches
Just to hear your speeches,
Thunderstorms of the midnight Watches;
And he dedicated a sigh to the ashes;
The fire went out; barely with ashes
He honored the patriarchal ashes
And he does not listen to friendly splashes,
What are our best wishes,
I broke the lilac bushes,
Picking berries in the bushes
The love of an innocent virgin breathes.
Or kiss the edge of your clothes.
He was a pedant in his clothes
A little bit of baby clothes,
No matter how hard he fights, even if he dies.
I know: they want to force the ladies
And you sensitive ladies,
They were guessing about their young ladies
To the lodges of unknown ladies;
You have seen similar ladies.
Now it's not that: and we, as ladies,
And the precious set of elegies
(I love friendly lies
I looked out the window and crushed flies.
And suddenly a leap, and suddenly it flies,
The whole house is full; whole families
Then he sees the forgotten enemies,
Not yet aiming, two enemies
Cloaks are thrown by two enemies.
Everyone in the world has enemies,
Your face is like the color of poppies.
Let's push back more boundaries,
Palaces, gardens, monasteries,
Before her is a motley regiment of liveries,
That snake of memories,
Are there any rebellious memories,
Other people's and their own victories,
Among the brilliant victories,
Alien to her: scary stories
Cherries, raspberries,
Sprinkle with cherries,
Blessed is the day of worries,
To see foreign countries;
He sang those faraway countries,
I don't want to quarrel for two centuries.
You, the idol of thirty centuries!
Tribes of the past treaties,
In a village without big vanities:
To the noise of brilliant vanities
His daily activities
Pour out pleas, confessions, penalties,
Mind not heeding strict penalties,
I also foresee difficulties:
Tatiana's pale beauties,
But the love of gentle beauties
There are new generation of beauties,
And you, young beauties,
He no longer fell in love with beauties,
The initial beauties:
No foreign beauties,
Girls, beauties,
There were Russian pancakes;
There are involuntary tribute lakes
More cupids, devils, snakes
Oh legs, it's full of mistakes!
And sweet Tanya's youth pales:
(Empty nonsense, tall tales,
Old stories, tall tales
Collecting area fables,
Under the long tablecloth of the tables,
Philosophical tables,
So the bunny in the winter trembles,
And he suspected miracles.
There is a roar of music, a sparkle of candles,
Combs, steel nail files,
And stoves in colorful tiles.
The slave is cunning from the shackles
For the honor of accepting his shackles
It sparkles and sparkles;
The cart rushes through potholes.
That the husband was mutilated in battles,
My uncle has the most honest rules,
With us and in our names
They shed tears three times;
Heroes of Whist; eight times
Sometimes
He is shy and impudent, and sometimes
Leaning on the table, sometimes
We like to listen sometimes
He only dares sometimes,
They disturb the heart sometimes:
How often do I fly sometimes,
Enmity sometimes
But you, the disparate volumes
That's how the poor moth shines
The ray of the luminaries of the night shines;
It is between the printed lines
In the shade of two outdated pines.
Both almanacs and magazines,
I haven't read our magazines
Take a walk, dear ones!
Read into the eyes of your dear ones
Let's run away, dear ones,
You, the indifferent lucky ones,
To the magic tunes
The merchant gets up, the peddler goes,
Guillot, offers him a robe and shoes
And he weaves poor shoes.
The fireplace is barely breathing. Smoke from pipes
In the color of joyful hopes,
But distant hopes
Meanwhile, rural cyclopes
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
During the days of fun and desires
You drink the magic poison of desires,
I have known the voice of other desires,
The old man inquires.
Go to the Nevsky shores,
The careful traveler also snores
Pharmacies, fashion stores,
There is a friend of innocent pleasures
And the noise of their windy pleasures.
The renegade of stormy pleasures,
He has forgotten features.
Present clear features
Olga has no life in her features.
I liked his features,
Animated creatures,
There are millions of bipedal creatures
There are many sad adventures.
She did not enliven the canvases.
I only notice in parentheses,
And by the way, I'll note in parentheses,
With fire and sighs and praises
For passionate sighs and praises.
And the day gradually rises.
Their wilfulness or impulses
Tatiana is in a corner and composes
And romantic roses;
Judge what kind of roses
Drawing in fiery verses
Carry him, and the horses
On three roan horses;
There are light patterns on the glasses,
Thirst asks for more glasses
Here under the window, wearing glasses,
Behind him is a line of narrow, long glasses,
Old age is guessing through glasses
A long silence passes,
Beauties light headdresses,
Charming actresses,
Jam in jars, mattresses,
And glory! But it promises losses
Like the heat, with golden crosses
And flocks of jackdaws on crosses.
A disease that causes
Moscow dandies and circuses
In front of the darkened houses
Oh, you honorable spouses!
Balconies, lions on the gates
In their translation, he hates,
Returned to his penates,
Diana's breasts, Flora's lanites
Leaning on her elbows, Tatiana writes,
But the days of the past are anecdotes
Quecrrez-ous sur ces tabettes,
I will not give you jealous lorgnettes,
The hearts of the record coquettes!
He conceded in three and a half minutes,
They were silent for two minutes,
And together for a few minutes
Everything between them gave rise to disputes
To the noise of feasts and riotous disputes,
Mustache, bloody tongues,
Their natural virtues,
But ten o'clock strikes; he leaves,
So the tree has its own leaves
The melody of the Torquat octaves!
Adriatic waves,
And on the Baltic waves
How I envied the waves,
Under the robe of storms, arguing with the waves,
As I wished then with the waves
And plunge the reapers into the waves
And a powerful life gives
All this often gives
And everything that pleases, lives,
The village of Lensky, lives
Until Morpheus arrives,
The heir of all his relatives.
Which means exactly relatives.
Out the jealous whispers of fashionable wives.
But the conversation of their lovely wives
And units of themselves.
Men are against; and, crossing themselves,
The neighbors are whispering among themselves:
And about her among themselves
They make friends with her, lead her to themselves,
And the epigram moves
He loved the thick groves,
Straight scissors, curves
It would not have attracted the eyes.
The instant tenderness of the eyes
The smile of the mouth, the movement of the eyes
And there is noise in the hearing, and a sparkle in the eyes
It clouds the delicate eyes.
To catch with loving eyes,
I read with spiritual eyes
He doesn't believe his own eyes.
And, with tender eyes
Caught the gaze of her eyes;
But somehow the gaze of his eyes
He reads with his eyes
And he wanders wildly with his eyes,
He does not hear, tears from his eyes
With a sad thought in his eyes,
The enemies stand with downcast eyes.
With fire in downcast eyes,
I was looking for Lensky with my eyes,
And falls. Misty eyes
Three pairs of slender female legs.
As deceptive as their legs.
He walks between the chairs on his legs,
I can barely drag my legs.
And stately wigs.
Crested tails, fangs,
Full of sorrowful forebodings,
They are carrying household belongings,
He blamed himself for a lot of things:
Although he has other things
Writing poems about other things,
And the boredom of festive undertakings.
Long-silenced feelings;
He could have discovered the feelings,
A story full of feelings,
Being a petty slave's feelings?
Always lofty feelings,
My fashion house and evenings,
In their house these evenings:
Do you spend your evenings?
And the haze of Epiphany evenings.
That they didn't get fashionable rings.
Around the ladies as near the paintings.
No wise truths, no paintings,
A series of tedious paintings,
Honorary citizen of the wings,
There, there under the wings
And it cracks and flaps its wings;
They loved round swings,
Cherished songs,
He proudly preserved in the songs
The boys dispersed the dogs,
In caravans, in chaises and in sleighs.
The goddess of secrets and gentle sighs.
To sort out the epigraphs,
And there he triumphs.
Surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
Here's the time: good sloths,
What stirred in the depths
And in my mind I said: Here he is!
It's nice to see how stubborn he is
But our hero, whoever he is,
Is it really him?.. That's right, he is.
How charmed she is.
Blessed though, maybe she is
He breathed, howled, and here she is
To the old woman with grief she is.
She dreams that she is
I know: in your heart there is
How beautiful her wonderful gaze is!..
Let's go to where the stream is,
I couldn't understand how important Makeup is
When would you know how terrible it is
Now I see what it is:
He opened the door. Well, his
The poet died, but his
And in a voice, everything was decided like this,
(In the likeness of this)
That's why I'm writing this,
Seeing the terrible harm in this,
He's so used to getting lost in this,
And it serves you right: in a strict analysis,
And equally strict analysis
Patches of snow; through the peaks
And you, familiar mountain peaks,
The letter where the heart speaks,
I've seen other freaks,
Hung on the branches of the oaks;
Drive off into the field to the two oaks.
Boulevards, towers, Cossacks,
You, Levshin's school chicks,
He sang out of tune. Splashes, clicks
Without any malice and tricks,
But in the midst of sad rocks,
By the sea on the granite rocks.
Scaring a herd of wild ducks:
The matchmaker went for two weeks
Please accept my thanks,
Who has fame, money and ranks
Or was he flirting, playing pranks,
And there were childish pranks
He scolded me a little for pranks
Mother Winter's pranks.
He drinks
Like the women, he left the books,
He lined the shelf with a squad of books,
Then I started reading books.
But I didn't see any harm in books;
I didn't look at other books.
I read some of our books,
Interpretation of other people's quirks,
And a lot of his quirks.
In the midst of seductive networks.
And where are the madrigals
Lensky does not write madrigals
And write them madrigals!
I didn 't bother with strict morals,
He has his rivals,
With the glory of red heels
He'll rub the old man's laurels!
To your flowers, to your novels
Memories of previous years novels,
And think about the beauty of nails:
St.-Rest, your pencils;
It grows, worries, boils
From the library of devils,
I would still love balls.
I was crazy about balls:
With Onegin, he recalls
Among the fashionable and ancient halls.
Portraits of kings on the walls,
And the early ringing of the bells,
Me with tears of spells
And in the midst of the midday swells,
Among the fields, around the hills;
But the whispers, the laughter of fools
Necessary fools;
Having arrived home, pistols
And he jumps. A couple of pistols,
The barking of the mosek, the smacking of the girls,
The song of the girls
Play it out girls,
About evil spirits and about girls;
Smile, flaxen curls,
Cold and lazy souls?
His involuntary devotion to Dreams,
And you, cherished dreams,
I hold a happy stirrup in my cherished dreams
A saint of fulfilled dreams,
Unrelated dreams,
Other, cold dreams,
Who has not indulged in strange dreams,
A fortune teller, an interpreter of dreams.
And the hearts are trembling dreams.
Love captivating dreams
Freedom-loving dreams,
What are our fresh dreams
The language of girlish dreams
I decorated her with dreams.
Empty, black dreams;
Immersed in her dreams,
For entertainment, for dreams,
Your secret heat, your dreams,
Who reads his dreams
Hopes, pranks, dreams.
To my infant dreams
You are haunted by dreams:
But I am the fruit of my dreams
I remember them all, and in my dreams
You appeared to me in my dreams
And arguments, and funny dreams!
You holy poetry dreams!
Dreams are easy dreams;
Forest shadow, the murmur of streams,
They escaped in muddy streams
You village Priams,
About different dishes and traffic jams,
The fire of unexpected epigrams.
And the anger of dark epigrams.
No areal epigrams,
Near unfinished poems,
And how many jokes and poems,
(Not to mention poems);
Excerpts from northern poems,
Like Bogdanovich's poems.
He takes a pen; his poems,
The subject of my innocent poems,
I got into five fathoms,
He sings all night; the rosehip blooms,
He appeared in the living rooms;
The girls in Tatiana's rooms
He held me in his arms.
That one has no charms,
No art dorms;
That's how the shadow dresses the storms
Above her and in the midst of rebellious storms
Great albums,
But there is the same trembling in the Persians,
The disease of the newest Russians.
The wagon train is ordinary, three caravans
There is one shining among the wives and maidens.
She's in the albums of gentle maidens,
Bukharans, sleighs, vegetable gardens,
And quietly the edge of the earth brightens,
She was worried about the signs;
And softly carpeted mountains
So slowly down the slope of the mountains,
There is already snow from the surrounding mountains
Greetings from a friend, the affection of virgins;
Secrets are heartfelt, secrets of virgins,
A sweet little cat to the heart of virgins.
Dangerous for the heart of virgins)
Are you still the same? Are the other virgins,
To whom, in a crowd of jealous virgins,
To whom, for their sins,
I will say without the madrigal sequins:
We're all looking at the Napoleons.;
And unbridled passions.
There is a single arbitrariness of passions,
Are you frivolous of passions?
No common opinions, no passions.
But more often they were occupied by passions
Or rather, there is no place for confessions
Alone among his possessions,
He was a victim of violent delusions
My flying creations,
However, there are several creations
To clean from deviations.
Alone, immersed in calculations,
We wandered around the world. Congratulations
Send greetings, congratulations;
Insomnia, light inspirations,
What a storm of sensations
Oligarchic conversations,
That there are too many conversations
There are bedbugs and fleas at the stations
The mind of cold observations
All the same to hear objections,
I don't anticipate any objections.
There are a lot of contradictions,
Threats, rumors, predictions,
I once read the instructions,
She fell in love with deceptions
Destroy preconceptions,
But (there are no rules without exceptions)
My mother's lessons.
Other, strict concerns
Boys, shops, lanterns,
And know and fashion patterns,
Bowing their cheerful horns,
And he shakes his hand and burns
But brighter, brighter it just burns
Afraid of expensive runs,
Paris county towns,
And ladies and fashionable weirdos.
We honor everyone with zeros,
The one from which he keeps
And with timid steps
He flew up the marble steps,
Here are five more steps,
Zaretsky thirty-two steps
Following their captivating footsteps
In your narrow footsteps,
Beckoning to the sails of ships.
To touch sweet feet with your lips!
With a light smile on his lips.
It does not take away from greedy lips
The fire of night lamps;
For the heart, for magazine bumps
It came, scattered; in clumps
And I was so hard on the ears!
It will catch you suddenly, then out of your ears
And he didn't scare anyone's ears.
Involuntarily, my dears,
Whatever he notices or hears
The dance of stars disappears,
She suppressed tears,
And these letters and tears.
And the languid gaze was full of tears.
Girlish fainting, tears
She coughed in tears.
Father and mother, in tears,
You will start crying: your tears
Deceptions, gossip, rings, tears,
Immature and withered years,
A magical land! There in the old years,
About your old years:
And this mixture of ranks and years.
There is no return to dreams and years;
He was able to endure with the years;
At least respect for the years
The bride of the ripe years,
But dolls even in these years
How they were written in the powerful years,
Pranks, jokes of former years.
We are the fading of our years,
At the turn of our years,
(Which was also the case in previous years,
That's how he killed eight years,
Free, in the color of the best years,
Alas! a friend of so many years,
Still the same after many years.
I've been fighting with the housekeeper for forty years,
Just a boat waving its oars,
Tatiana ah! And he roars,
The night has many lovely stars,
They barely took up the saucers,
They carry jam on saucers,
Smitten, Onegin shudders
He raised his nose and shoulders
There is a greedy regiment of lenders.
To the village, to the poor villagers,
Her pampered fingers
Friends are neighbors, their fathers.
But to send him to his fathers
I am ready to write to my great-grandfathers
Lower than the signatures of others
He was very different from others
Supervision of aunts, mothers
And our rhyming brothers
And what about Onegin? By the way, brothers!
I looked at all the tiers,
Automedons are our strikers,
And, come on, Tanya! These summers
Ah, he loved, as in our summers
And the truth is that in our summers
Our sad rhymers?
The torment of fashionable rhymers,
And so: for related dinners
She didn't play with the burners,
Is it possible? Just a little out of diapers,
Having conceived the idea of sailing through the bosom of the waters,
Look after your daughters:
Happy Dating Shelters;
To her shoulder; suddenly Olga enters,
Everything is clapping. Onegin enters,
Suddenly the doors are wide open. Lensky enters,
A caricature of southern winters,
Accept the collection of motley chapters,
On the monogram, given to two sisters,
Feather beds, cages with roosters,
He didn't see anything in the letters.;
Everything that rejoices and glitters
Two hearts, a torch and flowers;
Where are you crushing the spring flowers?
When churches and bell towers,
The name of the fervent players
About public affairs;
Stalls and chairs
The forerunner of morning labors,
Rest from labors,
Having lived without a goal, without labors
I will give you the fruits of my labors:
And I ended up with the neighbors.
And the curtain parted the floors;
A flicker, a whirlwind of fast vapors,
Or grammatical errors,
I spent time in front of mirrors
Of her beloved creators,
Whiny women and doctors.
Everyone sends Onegin to the doctors,
And a swarm of young traitors,
No tube of fashion connoisseurs
It is the will of heaven: I am yours;
Is Olga frisky yours?
He is not tolerated by the upper class.
In the window through the frozen glass
On the foggy glass
And the water is funny glass
Without pretensions to success,
Languishing and windy success,
Now I wouldn't recognize the princess!
But an indifferent princess,
But an unapproachable goddess
No one remembers, much less
Lies bright, boundless;
It's already been solved. Careless,
That ardent souls are careless
In this majestic, in this careless
In heartfelt letters, how careless!
And he remained motionless.
Tightened, mute and motionless,
The forest is before them; the pines are motionless
And suddenly her eyes are motionless,
The young man lies motionless,
He became restless,
For the fact that we are restless
And St. Petersburg is restless
You have paid tribute to madness.
He curses his madness
The singer of Feasts and languid sadness,
But I am sorry for the old sadness.
He sang separation and sadness,
And full of sincere sadness,
One habitual sadness.
It's time for hopes and tender sadness,
She is unfaithful to her sadness.
Someone else's delight, someone else's sadness,
I have known a new sadness;
Her embarrassment, her tiredness
A wreath was worthy of kindness.
Inimitable strangeness
Flowers, love, village, idleness,
And again, devoted to idleness,
Ready to ask her forgiveness,
And hopeless selfishness.
A treasured treasure of tears and happiness,
He can't give me happiness.
It is a substitute for happiness.
Intoxicated with the last happiness,
No service, no wife, no business,
We are happy to accept for business,
To Onegin. Well, business, business.
Describing is my business:
Languishing in mental emptiness,
Her absent-minded laziness.
Filled with passion and laziness
His yearning laziness,
I fell into a thoughtful laziness:
Leprosy, occasional weakness
The dawn rises in the cold darkness;
Blessed is the coming of darkness!
Walking in the middle of the evening darkness,
He lurks in the deep darkness.
I stayed in the frosty darkness
Does not coolly shine with sharpness;
Bored with their harness,
Where my days flowed in the wilderness,
But this gaze expressed tenderness:
To catch a moment of tenderness,
They sing, and, with carelessness
Health, life color and sweetness,
Dreams, dreams! Where is your sweetness?
He was an affectionate witness
I look at it with jealous shyness.
He rewarded me with a tender caress
For now, in the morning dress,
She goes out in an open dress,
I saw everything: faces, headdress
Everything, everything that I could express,
A tombstone, the temple of Cypress,
In front of the young mistress
At the feet of a beautiful mistress
A little nonsense in front of the hostess
The lady was approaching the hostess,
He had a question from the hostess.
Whitewashed. There is no hostess.
Alas, it is not difficult to guess!
So that the husband or the light did not guess
A young and fresh kiss,
For luxury, for fashionable bliss,
I will remember the speeches of the passionate bliss,
You call the dark bliss,
Nurtured in oriental bliss,
And all the shades of winter bliss;
But I'm not made for bliss.;
To pale and fade away is bliss!
And the world will bestow bliss.
To His momentary bliss;
We remember the bitter loss,
Sometimes with a short word, then with a cross,
With hands clasped in a cross.
Having connected, they will cross.
(A voluntary cross).
I was running after a nice fuss.
And before the roaring abyss,
Her heart feels tight, like an abyss
Who won't get tired of threats,
And, Phoebe's defying threats,
The rite of famous treats:
Military dandies, diplomats
Through a tight row of aristocrats,
From private and other debts,
And other things. Her doubts
Resolve my doubts.
Isn't it true: cute objects,
Sometimes, cute objects
Flying album Sheets
Dirty the flying sheets;
Notes on six sheets,
That's on the memory sheets
In their fields she meets
There is snow on the streets.
Two bullets
Pour the hot fat over the cutlets,
I'll note by the way: all poets
I'm falling for you, my poets;
Did you like soft carpets
Lay down in wavy carpets
In the anguish of insane regrets
With a soul full of regrets,
Set the table for two sets;
A deep, eternal chorus of shafts,
She carried her gifts
For everything, for all your gifts;
Could appreciate his gifts,
Double carriage lights
And the coachman, around the lights,
Replacement of dim lights.
The first dream of young delights,
Alas! Now it's days and nights,
Spinning, and, winter friend of the nights,
He sang in the silence of the nights.
In winter in the dark of the nights
And seductive nights.
Defender of liberty and rights
Where are you? Come: your rights
You retain your rights.
Your lucky rights,
He falls into both feelings and thoughts,
Magical sounds, feelings and thoughts;
In the anguish of love thoughts
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
In the excitement of his stormy thoughts,
Steel wet bits,
And belated outfits,
The minds of my hermits.
Eugene, hating lawsuits,
Proroem impudent vaults,
And here in the hut between the servants
Through the fingers of timid students:
I don 't like the elements
Alas, for various amusements
Her infant amusements;
The careless fruit of my amusements,
But the purpose of looks and judgments
A poet in the heat of his judgments
I also loved the spirit of his judgments,
And the mind is still shaky in its judgments,
Afraid of jealous judgments,
The subject of noisy judgments,
Children's appointments
To present to the grandparents
She is humble tents
Tatiana in the short table of contents
Two pine trees have grown together by their roots;
The husband comes. He interrupts
The neighbors gathered in carts,
But to young, virgin hearts
And he moves our hearts.
I listened to the clerk's reports
For the noise, for the storms, for the feasts,
He didn't like feasts.;
Of daily pleasures? Was he in the midst of feasts
And glitter and noisy feasts,
And to them in crazy feasts
Pots, chairs, chests,
Listening to the new noise of the forests;
She should stay in the wilderness of the forests.
The mysterious canopy of forests
And you, familiar forests;
Still transparent, forests
And scolds uninvited guests;
Hanging around the guests,
When I found out among the guests
Caricatures of all the guests.
She doesn't listen to the guests
There is great zeal for the guests,
The slow appearance of guests
Bows, shuffling of guests,
Beds are made; for guests
Letter: Prince N humbly requests
I closed my eyes to the ghosts;
Like a series of annoying ghosts.
Appeared to the eyes of the hellish ghosts;
The hostess shouts:
Zaretsky carefully puts
Blessing the ruts
Old Derzhavin noticed us
This is how nature created us,
One more thing separated us
That she deceived us;
The easier it is for her to like us
God have mercy and save us!
When in the garden, in the alley of us
A new face is calling us.
The Hussar Pykhtin was staying with us;
Where are the teachings they tell us,
He's completely forgotten us.
Perhaps it occurs to us
How long has it been brought to us?
Marriage will be a torment to us.
It is still new to us,
The feeling is wild and funny to us.
And they become funny to us
A holy mystery, and for us
As if it's impossible for us
Hymenaeus will prepare for us
Enlightenment is not appropriate for us,
Onegin is surely waiting for us.
There is only one weapon for us;
I don't see; but what's in it for us?)
He painted the first snow for us
Why did you visit us?
They will gladly accept us.
They didn't think about us.
Who is not spreading slander about us?
Who cares about us?
By the Almighty will of Zeus
Cornelius is a majestic genius;
But what was his true genius,
Flies like fluff from the mouth of Aeolus;
Like a windy Venus,
Shared it amicably? Now it is malicious,
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
The passions of others are rebellious,
To harbor hope, to be jealous,
Angry and coldly jealous!
And whist, hitherto famous,
So that the worm is despicable, poisonous
But tea is being brought; the girls are decorous
The melodies are sonorous.
In the wilderness, a lyrical voice is more sonorous,
And what about it? it is pleasant, sonorous;
She made me nervous.
And the grandmothers repeat in chorus:
The Heirs are an angry chorus
How often on the rocks of the Caucasus
He scolded Homer, Theocritus;
And a paw with sharp claws
The goose is heavy on red paws,
Then in them he paints rural views,
And belated reviews,
Inquiries, gossip and news
Treason by the fatal news,
And Tanya hears this news.
Herds roamed the meadows,
To the sunken meadows.
With its groves, meadows
Spent in inactivity, in the shadows
Shadows walk across the solid windows,
And, herald of the morning, the wind blows,
Where the bright stream flows,
He needs to fix his pillows,
Having come to terms with time (who knows?),
Along the sleepy street in rows
From the boxes and the chair rows.
He will furrow his brows
Hymena worries, sorrows,
Dreams, desires, sorrows
That's right, you'll read the vows
The Ghost of Irrevocable Days:
As a friend of my sad days,
To the song of the old days:
With dreams, the heart of the old days,
Wasn't that how I was in the old days
As it was in the old days
I will be faithful to the old days.
Let's talk about the old days.
Warm, dark old days,
And the youth of bygone days
The pen is not in fashion these days.
Which is kind of funny these days.
So, God grant them long days!
They drove for seven days.
Indulged in the red summer days
In the very morning of our days.
My happiest days?
From the most lullaby days,
And maybe for many days.
Where do they scold me like that nowadays,
I went to the bathhouse on Saturdays,
Irresistible rays
Driven by the external rays,
Looking at them, he says:
And finally she quietly says:
Gets the word sideways
Because he couldn't always
Worthy of old monkeys
And into the twilight of the lime alleys,
Dawn from the morning valleys
Sorry, peaceful valleys,
In those days in the mysterious valleys,
I know: Gentle Guys
It's called idag. (I can't
She's penetrated; she can't
Oh, listen, Lensky; but you can't
And for the journalists to eat
The evil mouth did not eat
She is trembling and bursting with heat,
He's out loud, in lyrical heat,
There's crowding, excitement, heat,
But he didn't want to cheat
And the bread maker, the German is neat,
The poet is modest, though great,
At that time, the pie was fat
In a sweatshirt, in an old hat.
And, Fleur turned away from the hat,
Ready to slap entrechat,
And common sense about this and that.
He starts talking about this and that;
He was reviled this way and that.
That is, he was able to judge that,
Native people are like that:
He didn't torment my soul like that!
And there is no case (their gender is like that);
And I took it in my arms like that!
Oh, nanny, nanny! Before that?
It is important to try to assure that,
He will captivate you, I am sure of that,
My friends, what's the use of that?
There is no conscience in that, there is no sense in that;
Unbearable (agree on that)
There was very little need for that,
I didn't try to blame them for that.
I was worried about that.
And I didn't care about that,
I couldn't help thinking about that;
And I loved you; so what?
But she can't. Can't you? But what?
Oh, the news, but what!
A Muscovite in a Harold's Raincoat,
But pantaloons, tailcoat, waistcoat,
His father lived in debt,
Being offended by such an act,
What is given to you does not attract
He finds her perfect
Now we have something wrong in the subject:
He gifted a favorite subject,
When did the nanny collect
Involuntary affection to expect,
But hush! Do you hear? The critic is strict
She appeared as a young lady of the district,
Eugene fell at her feet;
And, sobbing, at your feet
And now! What's at my feet
On the first leaf you meet
How is the kiss of love sweet;
The master's tea is too sweet,
The child was harsh, but sweet.
While the vigilant breget
Her bow was just as quiet.
An old woman in a long padded jacket;
Like a true Frenchman, in your pocket
With a seminarian in a yellow chalet
In the last taste of the toilet
Love is a tempting violet,
A current splashed from the comet;
The Widows of Clicquot or Moet
An admirer of Kant and a poet.
How he looked like a poet,
And he didn't become a poet.,
Or he didn't become a poet.
The mad soul of a poet
I will stop being a poet.,
All that is enviable for a poet:
In a frozen bottle for a poet
And he says: that was a poet!
If only I were like you, a poet.
Trike, the shrewd poet,
She could have raised it for centuries. The poet,
The clock is fixed: the poet
No sweet fictions of the poet,
He handed me a note from the poet.
She gave it to the poet
My friends, you feel sorry for the poet:
Or maybe even that: the poet
And secondly: let the poet
Rest in peace, young poet!
The murderer of the young poet?
And the memory of the young poet
The bed is covered with carpet,
Winters are a resplendent carpet.
Did you write poetry in secret,
Who's there in the crimson beret
With an involuntary sigh of regret:
At least with regret,
Indignation, regret,
And he left them without regret,
I'm embarrassed by regret;
A happy deadline was set.
Commands us to reset
It will take my merry sunset.
She wore a very narrow corset,
And on the floor is Monsieur Triquet,
Neater than a fashionable parquet
It hasn 't faded yet,
I haven 't known heartache yet,
I don't see any trouble here yet.
They haven't stopped stomping yet,
Eugene hasn't left yet,
I haven't clearly distinguished it yet.
No one has opened it yet.
Not a holiday, not an adopted gift,
Hold your lorgnette straight!
She came running noisily. Not without a fight
To see Olga before the fight,
But I'm not going to fight
I could be in front of a learned light
And lit up with a languid light
And where is the fugitive of people and light,
When it is transparent and light
Not thinking to amuse the proud light,
Hates the excitement of the light;
They have not yet been accomplished for the light,
Cheerful pouring out the light
And finally I saw the light.
Sometimes, the flattering voice of light
In the deadening rapture of light,
The oblivion of life in the storms of light,
Perhaps on the steps of light
To the decency of the law of light,
My progress in the vortex of light,
To the court of the discerning light
And, staring at an alien light
The moon in the silver light,
Changing the sweet, quiet light
And he went light
Getting up at first light,
He was younger than me, my light,
He was being chased in a noisy light,
She got up by candlelight.
A soulful flight?
And this pale half-light,
And the view out the window through the moonlight twilight,
She is Lenore, in the moonlight,
And on the grave in the moonlight,
He spends both day and night.
To sit with the patient day and night,
She's got me in the dark of the night
She's talking about him in the dark of the night,
Everything was quiet; only the night
It's like sleeping at night,
Like a drunken traveler at night,
The breath of the benevolent night
Is there a killing every night?
And the morning turns at midnight,
First of all (listen, am I right?),
And he was purring: You're right.
You guessed it; that's right:
Five hundred years later) roads, right,
There is no need; the law of fate is right.
Take it and find it right
That's what the young rake thought,
That's exactly what my Eugene thought.
They sit deep in thought,
His is full of stubborn thought.
Not because I read it.,
Don't deny it. I read it
Then Monseur changed it.
The fever of rhymes: he doubled it
To admit it: I would have borrowed it!
I enjoyed it
And our virgin enjoyed it
Maybe I did it:
Not knowing how to understand it,
I can't understand it.
Tatiana wants to find it.
Onegin could not find it.
It takes you out with the sun behind it
I didn't want to lose it.
I don't know how to translate it.)
But I can't translate it;
He had never dreamed of it.
(As you are, of course, familiar with it),
And suddenly he knew how to part with it,
I can't retell it.;
(What should we praise in it).
But now we see only in it
Where does your fast running go on it
It confused me; but I'm used to it
Forgotten. There is a familiar trail to it
But come on, come on; stop it:
And he waits: will it come? But he doesn't hear it.
A light steam was billowing under it.
And who came out from under it?
The morning snow crunches under it.
It's black and noisy under it
He was puzzling over it
I'll pay you back for it.
She's sitting there and that's it!..
Right up to the girlish. Everyone needs it
She searches for it and finds it
Diligently decorates it:
Although we don't want to admit it.
I wanted to limit it;
Suddenly he really got it
Well, what about it?
But I'll just tell you about it
When he saw it.
He used to enjoy it.,
And the more likely we destroy it
I didn't want to try it,
With a firm, quiet, even gait
And Lord Byron's portrait,
To my famous portrait
That I painted my portrait,
We all learned a little bit
And it starts a little bit
And I'll give you a thoughtful outfit.;
When wearing a man's outfit,
Or roses of flaming lanit,
An ardent and rather strange spirit,
Give you the forbidden fruit:
Both the lush color and the sweet fruit.
And exclamations, and bread and salt.
Tatiana silk belt
How castles should be built:
The venerable castle was built,
Sit down as it is difficult!
A learned fellow, but a pedant:
In duels, the classic and the pedant,
Everything for the whim of the abundant
But it is enough to glorify the arrogant
And they chant
Brought by a wandering merchant
Now, in advance, triumphant,
Winter!.. The peasant, triumphant,
He sulked and, indignant,
And what we called a frant.
Red currant.
You're in the hands of a fashionable tyrant
Dashing fashion, our tyrant,
And about Onegin the distant
And you, a living and constant,
And the gaze of a caring servant.
A French servant,
Devoting your leisure time to the innocent,
They disturb the sleep of the adolescent,
My stupid student.
Phoblas is a long-time student,
Although he looked at it, he couldn't be more diligent,
He was much less intelligent.
To appear proud and obedient,
Among the fans of the obedient
Always humble, always obedient,
He had a lucky talent
Wild, sad, silent,
When he is deaf and silent
At first I wanted to be silent;
It is even more pleasant to be silent
Always frowning, silent,
The Larin family fell silent.
We can argue, but I'm silent:
Sometimes it is prudent to keep silent,
She shuddered and was silent;
It turns pale, goes out and is silent!
Gvozdin, the host is excellent,
We have entered into an important agreement,
First, by mutual disagreement
Souls of inexperienced excitement
What a languid excitement
And Tanya, hiding her excitement,
Withered! Where is the hot excitement,
Along the St. Petersburg pavement,
Onegin from the first movement,
He said with amazement
And what did I find with amazement?
Everything was subject to their judgment.
I'm giving myself up to you for judgment.
He had to go with her to the regiment.
When the good enlightenment
To the ambassador of such an assignment
And the land of the fathers, and imprisonment?
Grabs a long knife, and in a moment
You came in a little bit, I found out in a moment,
The conversations stopped for a moment;
He was possessed for a moment;
I was captivated at least for a moment.,
I didn't read it in that quick moment!
And at this very moment
She has a heart full of torment,
Unhappy jealousy of torment,
Longing and rhyming torment,
I would not know the bitter torment.
And glory is a sweet torment
For the sadness, for the sweet torment,
How to keep resentment
To his sarcastic argument,
Starts an obscene argument.
I have no strength to repent,
So people (I'm the first to repent)
And it is destined to be completely different
Everything about them is so pale, indifferent;
Attentive or indifferent!
Selfishly indifferent
How ardently eloquent,
I'm bringing you to a social event;
The poor thing is going to faint;
Securely screwed flint
As in the meadows, your light footprint.
He stopped. To an old aunt,
The old woman said with a grunt.
He came back and got,
The clock is running; she forgot,
Onegin fired a shot
She seemed like the right shot
A cosmopolitan, a patriot,
To glorify your sad lot,
But you, to my unfortunate lot
Is this your lot
Pleased with his lot,
Which were not and are not
But the one that I dare not
Although this book was not
The other one has come: everything is not as it is not.
Those who have lived and thought cannot
That's in the fragile snow with a cute foot
And he beats the leg with a quick foot.
The shepherd, weaving his mottled lapot,
Madame de Stae, Bichat, Tissot,
Here it is: my friend, monseur Guot.
Of course, there must be contempt
To punish me with contempt.
What a bitter contempt
And the muses of sublime art,
But in the strict rules of art,
Recognition is also without art;
For the fact that he loves without art,
They sat down, and the venerable cart,
It ignited the blood in the withered heart,
Revive the slumber of the heart,
Revive the hopes of the heart
The fruits of the fullness of the heart,
He rests in the bliss of the heart,
From everything that is sweet to the heart,
And with a fiery and tender heart?
Tempted the younger heart;
And he worried her heart!
Doubts of your heart;
What have I found in your heart?
Don't despise people in your heart;
He revived Tanya's heart.
And he will touch someone's heart.;
In the impulses of his heart,
And the secret of his heart,
And he calmed the agony of his heart,
Was born for this life with his heart.
Now he is immersed in his heart!
Inspiration was beating in this heart,
Into oblivion he whispers by heart
They disturb my heart.
Where I buried my heart.
I would not give my heart!
Then I tore off my heart;
They will not touch my heart,
Loving the young man with all my heart,
I would have found a friend according to my heart,
And the thought sank into my heart;
So majestic, so smart,
And at the end of the last part
Her hands, or spread them apart
Enemies! How long have we been apart
Where to! and again, the matter is apart.
Then in the desert,
In the philosophical desert
When and where, in what desert,
Deciding to hate a flirt,
Manzoni, Herder, Chamfort,
When my head hurt;
Calling himself to a secret court,
Like Delvig drunk at a feast.
A weirdo, having got to a huge feast,
He was loved at least
It's been three hours at least
Having invented a trick and a breast
But summer flies fast.
Chefs prepare breakfast,
Hiding from the storms at last,
They fly off the coast.
And to remember the past?
Regretting the old, about the past:
Was he in the midst
They are the most expensive of the briefest
Olga has shoulders, what a chest!
Wash your face, shoulders and chest:
He was shot through the chest;
He puts his hand gently on his chest
They will produce it in my chest;
Premonitions pressed against my chest.
Change was glad to have a rest.
The alley to the lake, the forest,
How timid is the doe of the forest,
To the river through the lime forest.
Tatiana listened to him without protest.
That's right, an indifferent guest
I would have made an immodest request.
Your insolence, your vest
Like your waist,
The cunning lyricist
He arrives at evening whist,
Evening finds the mist
For long or by post,
Success inspired us first;
I was torn and cried at first,
Our Eugene conceived it first
You will perish, my dear; but first
He was born out of the dust,
In chronological dust
To breathe in the frosty dust
It is silvered with frosty dust
He also began to aim , but just
Get up. I must
I got married. You must,
Read: Here's Pradt, here's W. Scott.
You will love again: but
There are no inns. In a cold hut
And there is shouting and noise in the hut;
He was forgotten in his hut.
Tired look; slipped out
And the exclamations poured out.
She couldn't make out
The fire on the altar has gone out!..
The bassoon and flute rang out.
And Onegin went out;
So as not to forget who I'm singing about
About Olga, he writes about
Its seal is cut-out.
And Richardson and Rousseau.
He read Gibbon, Rousseau,
Isn't it true? I've heard you:
Having replaced, did they not replace you?
Let me introduce you:
Wait, I'll introduce you.
I'd like to introduce you
Oh, Brenta! No, I'll see you.
Even though we are innocently glad to see you.
When the devil will take you!
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
But where are you
And I see that I am blaming myself before you,
To freeze in agony before you,
But I don't want to praise you.;
No matter how much I love you,
Didn't I baptize you?
It's unbearable to see in front of you
Everywhere, everywhere in front of you
I'm crying in front of you,
From now on, I'm handing you,
In this pool, where am I with you
Friend, foe, I want to be with you
Not with him yet, not with you,
Albeit a small work. I knew with you
God grant that in this book you
I don't have time to tell you;
Who loves more than you,
The pledge is worthier than you,
I notice a spark of tenderness in you,
I want to warn you.
May God's thunder burn you!
I would never have known you,
Goodbye faithful to you;
Will I open my soul to you?
Isn't it true? It wasn't news to you
I will eventually report to you
Here is his letter exactly to you.
Is it more tolerable for you
In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,
And without that, heaven is not heaven for you.
However, he is a mountain for you:
And I am deprived of that: for you
Have mercy! And it's not difficult for you
It will hardly be pleasant for you.
You, the serpent constantly calls you
Paintings will not attract you:
And my Eugene has left you.
And this sermon But you
The world will forget me; but you
Moscow, I was thinking about you!
Onegin, I saw you,
Thank you. By you,
There is no ancient hunting in Peru
A wit, recently from Tambov,
My poet takes Tambov,
He approaches Olga Petushkov,
The county frenchman Petushkov,
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov
With the family of Panfil Harlikov
To Tatiana Lensky; Harlikov,
And a retired adviser to Flyanov,
My cousin's brother, Buyanov,
And I, imputing to myself the law
And far from my law.
My dead mother-in-law.
Purring, he washed his snout with his paw:
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
Before this clarity of view,
How could he seem new,
Everything else Eugene knew,
Everything that my Onegin knew
Hurry up! Go, go, Andrew!
I give it to you with a bow
Sometimes he will meet you with a bow,
I obey the magic bow,
She is well; they told me to bow.
The white stone of Moscow
The Younger Graces of Moscow
There are many beauties in Moscow.
So is arrogant Moscow.
For Olga on a wide meadow
Twisting, he runs through a green meadow
He's chasing her like a shadow.;
Eugene! And lighter than a shadow
It stands like a menacing shadow,
His suffering shadow,
In winter, when the night shadow
Where is the bloody shadow
Tatiana was standing in front of the window,
And his mother threatens him through the window
Tatiana saw through the window
Onegin went to the window
Alone, sad under the window
And a pile of books, and under the window
That's a country house and by the window
Tanya sits down by the window.
She came in and sat by the window.
She sat silently by the window.
Something and somehow,
Did you drag yourself around somehow;
Didn't laugh it off somehow,
Trotting along somehow;
He didn't allow it somehow,
Lensky is unable to bear the blow;
Her father was a kind fellow,
How to lure a good fellow,
Our Zaretsky is an honest fellow
And under the down pillow
And soon, soon the storms will follow
U! How is it surrounded now
They have arrived now.
An hour or two passes, and now
But where is he now?
Reader, we will leave now,
What's in them? I'm glad to give it back now
You haven't forgotten until now,
You didn't like me Well now
What is her dream now?
But I have no time for him now.
Even now.
Latin is out of fashion now:
(What have I been jokingly saying up to now)?
The owner is full, but up to now
It's clearer now
And where is her sister now?
Let him live for now
Revel in it for now,
I've become clueless now.
And, curious, now
Have you been with him just now
A young heart. But now
Oh, legs, legs! Where are you now?
I'm crying with you now;
My joy is heavy now,
About the legs of ladies I know.
Only a nanny would know,
You would never know,
Tell me, Prince, don't you know,
In the northern, sad snow
That's what he sees: on the melted snow,
His horse, feeling the snow,
Buried deep in the snow.
And rainbows bring snow;
The radiance of pink snow,
It is covered with desert snow,
Always like this: frowning brow,
There was a languid world of his brow.
Under a hat with a cloudy brow,
She didn't even move an eyebrow.;
And they flew like an arrow.
Will I fall, pierced by an arrow,
We'll show Tanya tomorrow.
A young soul, a greedy sorrow;
And take a walk and relax:
He looks at the sunken wax:
Until the age of twenty-six,
Take also the combat box.
And I am a prudent Bordeaux
No, never in the heat of the day
He said: will I wait for the day?..
Thoughts will not flare up for a whole day,
Which took the whole day
Yes, Tatiana's name day
And after that, at home all day,
And often alone all day
A barely born day.
Outside the gate. Every other day
And long live to this day
From Romulus to the present day
Tanya is delivered every day
She appeared to him every day,
She waits for him every day;
He drives up every day;
We rode together every day
In the sun and on a frosty day,
What a soul! Someday
Dreaming with him someday
With me, it used to be on Sunday,
It's my turn today.
Where are the cross and the shadow of the branches today
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
Aurors of the northern Alay
And a bright day will begin to play;
Illuminated by Diana's ray,
Each other with the shore. Hurray!
He brings tea on a tray.
Your proud look will portray!
And the traveler is a stray,
What else can I say?
Your creations? They say,
The old man, joking in the old way:
Then the novel is in the old way
And I am very glad that the old way
Neglected in a humble way,
And then he was silent the whole way.
Fate and life in its own way,
Tatiana is afraid of the winter way.
I am entertained in a completely different way.
He can't escape in any way;
The longing of love drives Tatiana away,
The dashing droshky is being carried away
Sometimes she is instantly carried away:
For the mill. While away
And trembling and anger takes me away,
Oh, a lot, a lot of rock has gone away!
Guests are crowding, everyone is taking away
Did their bloodlust take them away?
It's too late; time has flown away
To make the burning go away.
And the fever does not go away.,
Without taking a step away!
He stood over the river. Far away
Getting away from everyone far away,
There are no others, but those are far away,
But my thoughts were far away;
And her heart was far away
Before which life is far away
So her thought wanders far away:
To shine, captivate and fly away.
There is not a single soul in the hallway.
There is another dictator in the doorway.
Who will he start with? Anyway:
Because he was yawning anyway
God knows who she's surrounded by,
The poet's memory flashed by
The spring of my days rushed by
Which in days gone by
My younger days were rushing by.
Or it will fly by,
I measured it with excellent accuracy,
Yes, maybe the fear of secrecy,
She is plunged into despondency,
They want to drip; they're ready
He believed that his friends were ready
Scare with desperation ready,
The cross-country sled is ready.
He said he was always ready.
He tells the servant to get ready
But a very sweet old lady;
At least, maybe another lady
But I'm talking to our lady.
When the brilliant lady
This Grandison was a nice dandy,
In front of him, roast beef is bloody,
Is it not a parody?
A secluded study,
At Kharitonya's in the alley
Bloomed like a hidden lily of the valley,
Streams of the neighboring valley.
Getting ready, for the sake of money,
And finally petrify
We will wilfully sanctify.
Is it silent and foggy?
He is from Germany foggy
Semyon Petrovich is also stingy,
Onegin comes with an apology.
Careless and healthy?
Yes, thank God, you're healthy!
And Flyanov, not quite healthy,
He's happy, he's almost healthy.
Is your whole family healthy?
And what does he live by, and why
He was wonderfully gentle. Is that why,
I don't know why)
I really don't know why;
It's excusable. Evgeniy,
There is no doubt: alas! Evgeniy
In this stupid sky.
In the serene deserts of the sky,
When in the pale sky
Like smoke across the blue sky,
Alone, under the Finnish sky,
I was flying through the dark sky
Onegin asked Lensky:
Rich, handsome, Lensky
He swore to infuriate Lensky
Leaning on the dam, Lensky
By the name of Vladimir Lensky,
Evgeny is waiting: here comes Lensky
Eugene looks at Lensky.
Zaretsky,
As I said, my Zaretsky,
Golden Nights of Italy
Far from his own Italy.
But so be it: let's say goodbye amicably,
Should we break up amicably?..
Having lost everything irrevocably;
It has already come to him unbearably.
They speak unfavorably.
It is also brought to the Assembly.
There is no answer. In one assembly
You, decorated nimbly
Fate brought me together, and so humbly
Having served perfectly nobly,
He held out his hand to her. Sadly
And she is afraid; and hurriedly
I cherish it sacredly,
I will undoubtedly
To answer sharply and stupidly,
They are focused on them more vividly.
She was following her wildly,
I love their legs; only hardly
Where everyone is breathing freely,
He believed in everything blithely,
I was blossoming serenely,
Onegin dries up and barely
Awkward, he's barely
We will change immensely:
But I'm tired of him immensely.
Devoted to Dreams immensely,
It was brought to the table immediately.
Once I get used to it, I'll fall out of love immediately;
He began to read again indiscriminately.
Shiny, windy, lively,
Everyone began to interpret furtively,
Mine! Yevgeny said menacingly,
I will portray it menacingly,
It is being prepared jokingly
I taught him everything jokingly,
I read Apuleius willingly,
It began to beat more often and more strongly.
Now let's eavesdrop stealthily
Neighbors are a kind family,
Children, the yard family
And so they introduced a stranger into the family
That's enough, honey, the whole family
That their immortal family
The traditions of the Russian family,
A simple, Russian family,
She's in her own family
Who will be there? my own family.
Isn't it true? All her family
About the kennel, about his family,
A monotonous family,
He's familiar to me, he's my family.
And the shelf, with their dusty family,
The soul is in it for a long time involuntarily
They stop involuntarily
She beat the maids angrily
I danced the mazurka easily
And I'm following her lazily.
Tatiana and Olga; quickly
Here, take it quickly!)
You need to explain yourself frankly.
(As they say, mechanically)
To govern autocratically,
What? Invitations? Really,
But not now. Even though I'm cordially
I wished to meet Onegin cordially
But her husband loved her cordially,
I'll quarrel again, and finally
To my family, and finally
Is it really finally
To love, to respect mentally
But soon the guests gradually
Gave three balls annually
And he bowed casually;
He leads her, gliding casually,
His life went on peacefully;
He could argue cheerfully,
Eugene stood thoughtfully,
He goes home thoughtfully;
They look at Tanya primly
Chasing love, and suddenly
I brought the answer solemnly.
When there is a severe melancholy
In short: Russian melancholy
There is no trace of night melancholy,
His blood was stirred early.
Blessed is he who celebrates life early
No: his feelings cooled down early;
On the third in the night. Waking up early,
Then he saw clearly,
Weeping bitterly,
Like a shadow, she wanders aimlessly,
So he wrote darkly and listlessly
Either explicitly, or surreptitiously,
London trades scrupulously
He speaks French perfectly
It is depicted quite correctly
You're right, and you'll point us out correctly
I reviewed all this strictly:
He began to raise the first one quietly.
Lensky dozed off quietly;
Tatiana languished secretly;
So that the lord's berries are secretly
Such gossip; but secretly
Touch everything lightly,
With a pen and paints slightly;
And the window is shining brightly,
Shaking his head importantly,
And then they separated importantly,
And he sleeps with her constantly.
Where our hero lived recently.
And maybe even more gently.
Tatiana was waiting impatiently,
It is impossible in any way; impatiently
I will yawn silently
Does not lift: bursts violently
Or it will touch you hotly
The other smiled slyly,
Vladimir replied dryly
Infuriate a misguided enemy;
Fashionable beauties are a fashionable enemy,
And there was a deep economy,
Petrovsky Castle. He's gloomy.
But where Melpomene is stormy
Onegin was in the opinion of many
Eugene was more tolerable than many;
What's tomorrow Lensky and Evgeny
The second Chadaev, my Evgeny,
Not the torments of secret villainy
In my wandering destiny,
Tell me about it, Nanny,
Tatiana, on the advice of the nanny
And he speaks quietly to the nanny:
Give me a pen, a paper, nanny,
He used to sound funny.,
She loved on the balcony
I didn't want to be in such agony.
It depicts death, not agony.
In the village, happy and horny,
And, pampered feelings are a joy,
County mothers are a joy,
And tears, secret torments are a joy
Tanya's favorite, He's a joy
And labor, and flour, and joy,
Enmity, love, sadness and joy
And the tightness, and the brilliance, and the joy,
It's Christmas Eve. That's the joy!
With inexplicable joy
A semi- painful joy:
There he brought out a sharp Shakhovskoy
When I wanted to destroy
He considered them an empty toy
Which makes us sleepy,
Morality makes us sleepy,
She's in the abandoned canopy.
They will argue about the grave canopy;
I'll go down into the mysterious canopy,
But was my Eugene happy,
Whispered: Isn't it true? I'm happy.
That's what he thought, and he was happy.
He's terribly unhappy.;
Where is the student exemplary
In the Academic Dictionary.
Snow fell only in January
There was a commotion, a farewell cry:
I'm ready to cry, I'm ready to cry!..
But Tanya couldn't cry;
Selfish and dry,
And she hands him the laundry.
Yes, for the humble cemetery,
There is an explanation for the sad mystery.
It was a tempting mystery,
To put to sleep with love flattery,
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
Otherwise, I used to be very,
He showed off his evil bravery:
Everything in Paris tastes hungry,
Pompous, but hungry
Brilliant, semi-airy,
Lovelace's dilapidated glory
And earn me a tribute of glory:
In its frowning glory;
I don't catch flying glory.
There Didlo was crowned with glory,
Farewell, witness of fallen glory,
And the ball shines in all its glory.
An old memory
He kept it in his memory.
I kept a lot of things in my memory
But here we congratulate you on your victory
His love is a younger story,
The magic of a secret story!
Go ahead, go ahead, my story!
We'll break up for this, I'm sorry!
Du comme faut (Shishkov, I'm sorry:
She can't see it, or she's not sorry;
In her confusion, Tanya was in a hurry,
No cards, no balls, no poetry.
Without eternal truths, without pedantry,
Who has been talked about for a century:
Which reflected the century
The ride is pleasant and easy.
Who is not bored with hypocrisy,
Neither by the freshness of her rosy
It's like they're busy.
He still hopes, he is busy;
But enough is enough. It's time for me to get busy
Is it not because in high society
So full of piety,
Love the insane anxiety
Who was released at fifty
Stretch out from the outposts of the city.
Sed aa tempora! Audacity
By his free vivacity.
High thoughts and simplicity;
Before this gentle simplicity,
When with such simplicity,
Provincial simplicity,
For the fact that in sweet simplicity
And the beauty of important simplicity.
Monotonous nudity.
Have you had time to tire of infidelity;
The poet, blessed with insensibility,
Souls are direct nobility,
Seething with impatient hostility,
First, let's prick the vanity
As an oppressive dignity
Well? You're going: it's a pity.
Then at least you had pity,
Keeping at least a drop of pity,
Courteously, with cold clarity
I like your sincerity;
What is the answer? one severity.
Hospitable antiquity.
The common people of antiquity,
According to all the traditions of antiquity
Yes, the customs of our antiquity.
And the glory of our antiquity,
In the taste of smart antiquity.
Her husband, but in captivity;
Vladimir sweet captivity
Full of Perplexity,
Full of perplexity
Hope, there is perplexity
(Unfortunately, too salty);
And the old ones are delirious with novelty.
For what is Tatiana more guilty?
Owning weakly and with difficulty,
And he expressed himself with difficulty
The humble are not without difficulty,
Eugene found out without difficulty
Who was a dandy or a grabber at the age of twenty,
Both wayward and empty
And Tanya enters the house empty,
Maybe it's all empty,
Everything is gone that the sound is empty,
You won't find it in you, the light is empty.
He excited a smile at a party
It's not good for a housewarming party,
There will be a ball, there will be a children's party.
A merry birthday party.
(A very painful property)
That all the girlfriends are dirty
The sun is playing; it's melting dirty
Had gout at the age of forty,
With her cold beauty
With an inexplicable beauty
That Nina is a marble beauty
Will you come, virgin of beauty,
Attracts conditional beauty
Not her sister's beauty,
I'm sorry, heavenly beauty,
By the letter of my beauty;
Or just be a good guy,
But he's certainly an honest guy.
He didn't die, he didn't go crazy.
That I almost went crazy
Or a staged Freischitz
Not thinking to amuse the proud light,
The attention of the friendship of the beloved,
I'd like to introduce you
The pledge is worthier than you,
More worthy than a beautiful soul,
A saint of fulfilled dreams,
Poetry is alive and clear,
High thoughts and simplicity;
But so be it with a biased hand
Accept the collection of motley chapters,
Half-funny, half-sad,
The common people, the ideal,
The careless fruit of my amusements,
Insomnia, light inspirations,
Immature and withered years,
The mind of cold observations
And the hearts of the sorrowful will be noticed.
My uncle has the most honest rules,
When I was seriously ill,
He forced himself to respect himself
And I couldn't think of a better one.
His example to others is science;
But, my God, what a bore
To sit with the patient day and night,
Without taking a step away!
What a low cunning
To amuse the half - dead,
He needs to fix his pillows,
It's sad to bring medicine,
Sigh and think about yourself:
When the devil will take you!
That's what the young rake thought,
Flying in the dust on the post office,
By the Almighty will of Zeus
The heir of all his relatives.
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
With the hero of my novel
Without preface, this is the hour
Let me introduce you:
Onegin, my good friend,
He was born on the banks of the Neva River,
Where maybe you were born
Or shone, my reader;
I used to walk there too:
But the north is bad for me.
Having served perfectly nobly,
His father lived in debt,
Gave three balls annually
And finally squandered.
Eugene's fate kept him safe:
At first Madame followed him,
Then Monseur changed it.
The child was harsh, but sweet.
Monseur Abbe, a poor Frenchman,
So that the child does not get exhausted,
I taught him everything jokingly,
I didn 't bother with strict morals,
He scolded me a little for pranks
And he took me for a walk in the Summer Garden.
When is the rebellious youth
It's time for Eugene,
It's time for hopes and tender sadness,
Monseur was chased out of the yard.
Here is my Onegin at large;
Cut in the latest fashion,
How dandy london is dressed
And finally I saw the light.
He speaks French perfectly
He could express himself and wrote;
I danced the mazurka easily
And he bowed casually;
What do you want more? The light has decided,
That he's smart and very nice.
We all learned a little bit
Something and somehow,
That's the way of education, thank God,
It's easy to shine here.
Onegin was in the opinion of many
(resolute and strict judges)
A learned fellow, but a pedant:
He had a lucky talent
Without compulsion in conversation
Touch everything lightly,
With the scholarly air of a connoisseur
To remain silent in an important dispute
And make the ladies smile
The fire of unexpected epigrams.
Latin is out of fashion now:
So, to tell you the truth,
He knew quite a lot of Latin.,
To sort out the epigraphs,
To talk about Juvenal,
At the end of the letter, put ae,
Yes, I remembered, though not without sin,
There are two verses from the Aeneid.
He had no desire to rummage
In chronological dust
Everyday life of the earth:
But the days of the past are anecdotes
From Romulus to the present day
He kept it in his memory.
Having no high passion
For the sounds of life, do not spare,
He couldn't get rid of the chorea,
No matter how hard we fought, to distinguish.
He scolded Homer, Theocritus;
But I've read Adam Smith.
And there was a deep economy,
That is, he was able to judge that,
How the state gets richer,
And what does he live by, and why
He doesn't need gold.,
When a simple product has.
His father couldn't understand him
And he gave the land as collateral.
Everything else Eugene knew,
I don't have time to tell you;
But what was his true genius,
What did he know more firmly than all the sciences,
What was the difference for him
And labor, and flour, and joy,
Which took the whole day
His yearning laziness,
There was a science of tender passion,
Which Nazon sang,
Why did he end up a sufferer
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
Far from his own Italy.
How early could he be a hypocrite,
To harbor hope, to be jealous,
To disbelieve, to make believe,
To appear gloomy, to languish,
To appear proud and obedient,
Attentive or indifferent!
How languidly silent he was,
How ardently eloquent,
In heartfelt letters, how careless!
One breathing, one loving,
How could he forget himself!
How his gaze was quick and gentle,
He is shy and impudent, and sometimes
He shone with an obedient tear!
How could he seem new,
Joking innocence amaze,
Scare with desperation ready,
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
To catch a moment of tenderness,
Innocent years of prejudice
The mind and passion to win,
Involuntary affection to expect,
Beg and demand recognition,
Eavesdrop on the heart's first sound,
Chasing love, and suddenly
To achieve a secret date
And then she's alone
Give lessons in silence!
How early could he have disturbed
The hearts of the record coquettes!
When I wanted to destroy
He has his rivals,
How sarcastically he slandered!
What kind of nets I prepared for them!
But you, blessed husbands,
You were friends with him.:
He was caressed by his evil husband,
Phoblas is a long-time student,
And an incredulous old man,
And the cuckold is majestic,
Always happy with himself,
His lunch and his wife.
He used to be still in bed:
They bring notes to him.
What? Invitations? Really,
Three houses are calling for the evening:
There will be a ball, there will be a children's party.
Where will my prankster go?
Who will he start with? Anyway:
It's no wonder to keep up everywhere.
For now, in the morning dress,
Wearing a wide bolivar,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
And there he walks in the open,
While the vigilant breget
Lunch won't ring for him.
It's already dark: he's getting into the sled.
It is silvered with frosty dust
His beaver collar.
He rushed to Taon: he is sure,
What's waiting for him there?
Entered: and a cork in the ceiling,
A current splashed from the comet;
In front of him, roast beef is bloody,
And truffles, the luxury of youth,
French cuisine is the best color,
And Strasbourg is an imperishable pie
Between the Limburg cheese alive
And a golden pineapple.
Thirst asks for more glasses
Pour the hot fat over the cutlets,
But the ringing of the breguet brings them,
That the ballet has started a new one.
The theater is an evil legislator,
A fickle admirer
Charming actresses,
Honorary citizen of the wings,
Onegin flew to the theater,
Where everyone is breathing freely,
Ready to slap entrechat,
To lick Phaedra, Cleopatra,
To call Moina (in order to,
Just so you can hear him).
A magical land! There in the old years,
Satires the bold lord,
Fonvizin, a friend of freedom, shone,
And the enterprising Prince;
There are involuntary tribute lakes
People's tears, applause
I shared it with the younger Semenova;
There our Katenin resurrected
Cornelius is a majestic genius;
There he brought out a sharp Shakhovskoy
Their comedies are a noisy swarm,
There Didlo was crowned with glory,
There, there under the wings
My younger days were rushing by.
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
Hear my sad voice:
Are you still the same? Are the other virgins,
Having replaced, did they not replace you?
Will I hear your choirs again?
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
A soulful flight?
Or a dull gaze will not find
Familiar faces on the boring stage,
And, staring at an alien light
A disappointed lorgnette,
An indifferent spectator of fun,
I will yawn silently
And to remember the past?
The theater is already full; the boxes are shining;
Stalls and chairs
There is an impatient splashing in the neighborhood,
And the curtain rises And makes a noise.
Brilliant, semi-airy,
I obey the magic bow,
Surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
Istomina is standing; she,
One foot touching the floor,
The other is slowly circling,
And suddenly a leap, and suddenly it flies,
Flies like fluff from the mouth of Aeolus;
Then the camp will develop, then it will develop
And he beats the leg with a quick foot.
Everything is clapping. Onegin enters,
He walks between the chairs on his legs,
Double lorgnette obliquely induces
To the lodges of unknown ladies;
I looked at all the tiers,
I saw everything: faces, headdress
He's terribly unhappy.;
He bowed to the men from all sides,
Then to the stage
I looked at it in great distraction,
He turned away and yawned,
And he said:
I've been putting up with ballets for a long time,
But I'm tired of Didlo too.
More cupids, devils, snakes
There is jumping and noise on the stage;
More tired footmen
They sleep on fur coats at the entrance;
They haven't stopped stomping yet,
Blowing your nose, coughing, shushing, clapping;
More outside and inside
Lanterns are shining everywhere;
Still, having vegetated, the horses are fighting,
Bored with their harness,
And the coachman, around the lights,
They scold the gentlemen and beat them in the palm of their hands
And Onegin went out;
He's going home to get dressed.
Will I depict the faithful in the picture
A secluded study,
Where is the student exemplary
Dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Everything for the whim of the abundant
London trades scrupulously
And on the Baltic waves
He carries us for the forest and lard,
Everything in Paris tastes hungry,
A useful trade having chosen,
Invents for fun,
For luxury, for fashionable bliss,
Everything decorated the office
A philosopher at the age of eighteen.
Amber on the tubes of Tsargrad,
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
And, pampered feelings are a joy,
Perfume in faceted crystal;
Combs, steel nail files,
Straight scissors, curves
And brushes of thirty kinds
Both for nails and teeth.
Rousseau (I'll note in passing)
I couldn't understand how important Makeup is
Dared to clean his nails in front of him,
An eloquent madcap.
Defender of liberty and rights
In this case, he is completely wrong.
You can be a good person
And think about the beauty of nails:
Why is it fruitless to argue with the age?
The custom is despot among people.
The second Chadaev, my Evgeny,
Afraid of jealous judgments,
He was a pedant in his clothes
And what we called a frant.
It's been three hours at least
I spent time in front of mirrors
And he came out of the bathroom
Like a windy Venus,
When wearing a man's outfit,
The goddess is going to a masquerade.
In the last taste of the toilet
Taking your curious gaze,
I could be in front of a learned light
Describe his outfit here;
Of course it would be brave,
Describing is my business:
But pantaloons, tailcoat, waistcoat,
All these words are not in Russian;
And I see that I am blaming myself before you,
Well, my poor style
I could have been much less colorful
In foreign words,
Even though I looked in a long time ago
In the Academic Dictionary.
Now we have something wrong in the subject:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
Where to go headlong in the Yamskaya carriage
My Onegin has already galloped.
In front of the darkened houses
Along the sleepy street in rows
Double carriage lights
Cheerful pouring out the light
And rainbows bring snow;
Dotted with bowls all around,
A magnificent house is shining;
Shadows walk across the solid windows,
Head profiles flicker
And ladies and fashionable weirdos.
Here our hero drove up to the entrance hall;
He shot past the doorman
He flew up the marble steps,
Straightened his hair with his hand,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
The music is too tired to rattle;
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
There is noise and crowding all around;
The spurs of the cavalry are strumming;
The legs of lovely ladies are flying;
Following their captivating footsteps
Fiery eyes are flying,
And the roar of the skripok drowned
Out the jealous whispers of fashionable wives.
During the days of fun and desires
I was crazy about balls:
Or rather, there is no place for confessions
And for the delivery of the letter.
Oh, you honorable spouses!
I will offer you my services;
Please notice my speech:
I want to warn you.
You are also, mothers, stricter
Look after your daughters:
Hold your lorgnette straight!
That's not it, God forbid!
That's why I'm writing this,
That I haven't sinned for a long time.
Alas, for various amusements
I've ruined a lot of my life!
But if morals didn't suffer,
I would still love balls.
I love the frenzied youth,
And the tightness, and the brilliance, and the joy,
And I'll give you a thoughtful outfit.;
I love their legs; only hardly
You will find the whole of Russia
Three pairs of slender female legs.
Ah! I couldn't forget for a long time
Two legs Sad, cold,
I remember them all, and in my dreams
They disturb my heart.
When and where, in what desert,
Madman, will you forget them?
Oh, legs, legs! Where are you now?
Where are you crushing the spring flowers?
Nurtured in oriental bliss,
In the northern, sad snow
You didn't leave any traces:
Did you like soft carpets
A luxurious touch.
Have I forgotten for you for a long time
And thirst for fame and praise,
And the land of the fathers, and imprisonment?
The happiness of the young years has disappeared,
As in the meadows, your light footprint.
Diana's breasts, Flora's lanites
Lovely, dear friends!
However, the leg of Terpsichore
It's more charming than anything to me.
She, prophesying to the gaze
An invaluable reward,
Attracts conditional beauty
Desires are a self-willed swarm.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
Under the long tablecloth of the tables,
In the spring on the grasslands,
In winter, on the cast iron fireplace,
There is a hall on the mirrored parquet floor,
By the sea on the granite rocks.
I remember the sea before the storm:
How I envied the waves,
Running in a stormy line
Lay down at her feet with love!
As I wished then with the waves
To touch sweet feet with your lips!
No, never in the heat of the day
My boiling youth
I didn't want to be in such agony.
Kissing the mouths of the younger Armids,
Or roses of flaming lanit,
Or percy, full of longing;
No, never a rush of passion
He didn't torment my soul like that!
I remember another time!
Sometimes
I hold a happy stirrup in my cherished dreams
And I feel the leg in my hands;
Imagination is boiling again,
Her touch again
It ignited the blood in the withered heart,
More longing, more love!..
But it is enough to glorify the arrogant
With your loquacious lyre;
They are not worth any passion,
No songs inspired by them:
The words and gaze of these witches are
As deceptive as their legs.
What about my Onegin? Half asleep
He's going to bed from the ball:
And St. Petersburg is restless
Already awakened by the drum.
The merchant gets up, the peddler goes,
A cab pulls to the stock exchange,
Ohtenka is in a hurry with the jug,
The morning snow crunches under it.
I woke up in the morning with a pleasant noise.
The shutters are open;
The pipe smoke rises in a column of blue,
And the bread maker, the German is neat,
In a paper cap, more than once
He was already opening his vasisdas.
But, tired of the noise of the ball
And the morning turns at midnight,
Sleeping peacefully in the shadow of the blessed
Fun and luxury child.
He'll wake up in the afternoon, and again
His life is ready until morning,
It is monotonous and variegated.
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
But was my Eugene happy,
Free, in the color of the best years,
Among the brilliant victories,
Was he in the midst
Of daily pleasures? Was he in the midst of feasts
Careless and healthy?
No: his feelings cooled down early;
He was bored with the light and the noise;
The beauties didn't stay long
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
Have you had time to tire of infidelity;
Friends and friendship are boring,
Because he couldn't always
Beef steaks and Strasbourg pie
Pour champagne over a bottle
And pour out sharp words,
When my head hurt;
And even though he was an ardent rake,
But he finally fell out of love
And swearing, and a saber, and lead.
A disease that causes
It would have been time to find it long ago,
Similar to the English spline,
In short: Russian melancholy
It took hold of him little by little;
He's going to shoot himself, thank God,
I didn't want to try it,
But he has completely cooled down to life.
Like Chd-Harod, sullen, languid
He appeared in the living rooms;
No gossip of the world, no Boston,
Neither a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
Nothing touched him,
He didn't notice anything.
The vagaries of the big world!
He left all of you before;
And the truth is that in our summers
The higher tone is rather boring;
At least, maybe another lady
Interprets Sey and Bentham,
But in general their conversation
Obnoxious, though innocent nonsense;
Besides, they are so immaculate,
So majestic, so smart,
So full of piety,
So circumspect, so precise,
So unapproachable for men,
That the sight of them gives birth to a splinter.
And you, young beauties,
Which I sometimes get late
The dashing droshky is being carried away
Along the St. Petersburg pavement,
And my Eugene has left you.
The renegade of stormy pleasures,
Onegin locked himself in at home,
Yawning, he took up the pen,
I wanted to write, but it was hard work
He was sick of it; nothing
It did not come out of his pen,
And he did not get into the perky workshop
People I don't judge,
Because I belong to them.
And again, devoted to idleness,
Languishing in mental emptiness,
He sat down with a laudable purpose
To appropriate the mind of someone else;
He lined the shelf with a squad of books,
I read and read, but all to no avail:
There's boredom, there's deception or nonsense;
There is no conscience in that, there is no sense in that;
There are different chains on all of them;
And the old thing is outdated,
And the old ones are delirious with novelty.
Like the women, he left the books,
And the shelf, with their dusty family,
He drew it with a mourning taffeta.
The conditions of light overthrowing the burden,
How is he, lagging behind the hustle and bustle,
I became friends with him at that time.
I liked his features,
His involuntary devotion to Dreams,
Inimitable strangeness
And a sharp, chilled mind.
I was angry, he was sullen;
We both knew the passion game;
The life of both of us was tormenting;
In both hearts, the heat faded;
Malice awaited both of them
Blind Fortune and people
In the very morning of our days.
Those who have lived and thought cannot
Don't despise people in your heart;
Those who felt it are worried
The Ghost of Irrevocable Days:
That one has no charms,
That snake of memories,
That one is gnawing at remorse.
All this often gives
The great charm of conversation.
First, Onegin's language
It confused me; but I'm used to it
To his sarcastic argument,
And jokingly, with bile in half,
And the anger of dark epigrams.
How often do I fly sometimes,
When it is transparent and light
The night sky over the Neva
And the water is funny glass
Does not reflect the face of Diana,
Memories of previous years novels,
Remembering the old love,
Sensitive, careless again,
The breath of the benevolent night
We were silently reveling!
How to get into the green forest from prison
The sleepy well was moved,
So we were carried away by a dream
To the beginning of a young life.
With a soul full of regrets,
And lean on the granite,
Eugene stood thoughtfully,
How Pete described himself.
Everything was quiet; only the night
The sentries called to each other,
Yes droshky a distant knock
From the Millionth there was a sudden;
Just a boat waving its oars,
I was floating on a dormant river:
And we were captivated in the distance
The horn and the song are bold
But sweeter, in the midst of nocturnal fun,
The melody of the Torquat octaves!
Adriatic waves,
Oh, Brenta! No, I'll see you.
And, full of inspiration again,
I will hear your magical voice!
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
By the proud lyre of Albion
He's familiar to me, he's my family.
Golden Nights of Italy
I'm not going to enjoy myself on the outside,
With the young Venetian,
Sometimes talkative, sometimes mute,
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
With her my lips will find
The language of Petrarch and love.
Will the hour of my freedom come?
It's time, it's time!
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
Beckoning to the sails of ships.
Under the robe of storms, arguing with the waves,
Along the free crossroads of the sea
When will I start running free?
It's time to leave boring breg
I don 't like the elements
And in the midst of the midday swells,
Under the sky of my Africa,
Sigh for gloomy Russia,
Where I suffered, where I loved,
Where I buried my heart.
Onegin was ready with me
To see foreign countries;
But soon we were the fate
Divorced for a long time.
His father died then.
Before Onegin gathered
There is a greedy regiment of lenders.
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Eugene, hating lawsuits,
Pleased with his lot,
Gave them the Inheritance,
The big loss is not seeing
Or having known it from afar
The death of the old man's uncle.
Suddenly he really got it
A report from the steward,
That my uncle is dying in bed
And I would be glad to say goodbye to him.
After reading the sad message,
Eugene is immediately on a date
I galloped headlong through the mail
And I was yawning in advance,
Getting ready, for the sake of money,
To sighs, boredom and deception
(And that's how I started my novel);
But after arriving at my uncle's village,
I found it on the table,
As a tribute to the finished land.
He found a yard full of services;
To the deceased from all sides
Enemies and friends gathered,
Hunters before the funeral.
The deceased was buried.
Priests and guests ate and drank
And then they separated importantly,
It's like they're busy.
Here is our Onegin, a villager,
Factories, waters, forests, lands
The owner is full, but up to now
Order is an enemy and a waster,
And I am very glad that the old way
Changed it to something else.
Two days seemed new to him
Secluded fields,
The coolness of the gloomy winter,
The murmur of a quiet stream;
On the third there is a grove, a hill and a field
He was not interested in more;
Then they induced sleep;
Then he saw clearly,
The boredom in the village is the same,
Although there are no streets or palaces,
No cards, no balls, no poetry.
Melancholy was waiting for him on guard,
And she was running after him,
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
I was born for a peaceful life,
For rural silence;
In the wilderness, a lyrical voice is more sonorous,
Creative dreams come alive.
Devoting your leisure time to the innocent,
I wander over a deserted lake,
And far from my law.
I am awake every morning
For sweet bliss and freedom:
I don't read much, I sleep a long time,
I don't catch flying glory.
Wasn't that how I was in the old days
Spent in inactivity, in the shadows
My happiest days?
Flowers, love, village, idleness,
Fields! I am devoted to you with all my soul.
I'm always happy to notice the difference.
Between Onegin and me,
To the mocking reader
Or some publisher
Elaborate slander,
Comparing my features here,
I didn 't repeat it godlessly afterwards,
That I painted my portrait,
Like Byron, the poet of pride,
As if it's impossible for us
Writing poems about other things,
As soon as it's about yourself.
I'll note by the way: all poets
Love is a dreamy friend.
Sometimes, cute objects
I dreamed, and my soul
I kept their secret image;
After that, the muse revived them:
So I, careless, sang
And the virgin of the mountains, my ideal,
And the captives of the shores of Salgir.
Now from you, my friends,
I often hear the question:
Who is your lyre sighing for?
To whom, in a crowd of jealous virgins,
Did you dedicate her tune?
Whose gaze, stirring inspiration,
He rewarded me with a tender caress
Your pensive singing?
Who did your verse idolize?
And, friends, no one, by God!
Love the insane anxiety
I had a dreary experience.
Blessed is he who has combined with her
The fever of rhymes: he doubled it
Poetry is a sacred delusion,
Petrarch marching after,
And he calmed the agony of his heart,
Caught and glory meanwhile;
But I, loving, was stupid and dumb.
Love has passed, the muse has appeared,
And the dark mind cleared up.
I'm free, I'm looking for an alliance again
Magical sounds, feelings and thoughts;
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
Near unfinished poems,
No female legs, no heads;
The extinguished ashes will no longer flare up,
I'm still sad; but there are no tears anymore,
And soon, soon the storms will follow
My soul will completely calm down:
That's when I'll start writing
A poem of songs at twenty-five.
I was already thinking about the form of the plan
And what will I call the hero;
For now, my novel
I have finished the first chapter;
I reviewed all this strictly:
There are a lot of contradictions,
But I don't want to fix them.
I will pay my debt to censorship
And for the journalists to eat
I will give you the fruits of my labors:
Go to the Nevsky shores,
A newborn creation,
And earn me a tribute of glory:
Crooked talk, noise and abuse!
The village where Eugene was bored,
There was a lovely corner;
There is a friend of innocent pleasures
I wish I could bless heaven.
The manor house is secluded,
Protected from the winds by a mountain,
He stood over the river. Far away
They were full of flowers and bloomed before him
Meadows and fields of gold,
Villages flashed by; here and there
Herds roamed the meadows,
And the canopy expanded thick
A huge, neglected garden,
The shelter of thoughtful dryads.
The venerable castle was built,
How castles should be built:
It is extremely durable and calm
In the taste of smart antiquity.
There are high chambers everywhere,
There are damask wallpapers in the living room,
Portraits of kings on the walls,
And stoves in colorful tiles.
All this is now dilapidated,
I really don't know why;
Yes, however, to my friend
There was very little need for that,
Because he was yawning anyway
Among the fashionable and ancient halls.
He settled in that room,
Where is the village old-timer
I've been fighting with the housekeeper for forty years,
I looked out the window and crushed flies.
It was simple: the floor was oak,
Two closets, a table, a down sofa,
There's not a speck of ink anywhere.
Onegin opened the cupboards;
I found a notebook in one of them.,
There's a whole line of liqueurs in the other,
Jugs of apple water
And the calendar of the eighth year:
An old man with a lot to do,
I didn't look at other books.
Alone among his possessions,
Just to spend time,
Our Eugene conceived it first
To establish a new order.
In his wilderness, the sage is desolate,
I am a member of the ancient corvee
I replaced it with a light fee;
And the slave blessed fate.
But he sulked in his corner,
Seeing the terrible harm in this,
His calculating neighbor;
The other smiled slyly,
And in a voice, everything was decided like this,
That he's a dangerous weirdo.
At first, everyone went to see him;
But since it's from the back porch
It was usually served
He needs a Don stallion,
Just along the main road
Their household will hear them,
Being offended by such an act,
Everyone stopped being friends with him.
He's a pharmacist; he drinks one
A glass of red wine;
He does not fit the ladies to the handle;
Everything is yes, yes, no; he will not say yes, sir
Or not, sir. That was the general voice.
To his village at the same time
The new landowner rode in
And equally strict analysis
I gave a reason in the neighborhood:
By the name of Vladimir Lensky,
With a soul straight from Gottingen,
Handsome, in full bloom,
An admirer of Kant and a poet.
He is from Germany foggy
He brought the fruits of scholarship:
Freedom-loving dreams,
An ardent and rather strange spirit,
Always an enthusiastic speech
And the curls are shoulder-length black.
From the cold debauchery of the world
It hasn 't faded yet,
His soul was warmed
Greetings from a friend, the affection of virgins;
He was an ignoramus at heart, dear,
He was cherished by hope,
And the world's new brilliance and noise
Still captivated the young mind.
He amused himself with a sweet dream
Doubts of your heart;
The purpose of our life is for him
It was a tempting mystery,
He was puzzling over it
And he suspected miracles.
He believed that his soul was his own
You must connect with him,
What, drearily languishing,
She waits for him every day;
He believed that his friends were ready
For the honor of accepting his shackles
And that their hand will not waver
To break the vessel of the slanderer;
What are the chosen of fate,
People are sacred friends;
That their immortal family
Irresistible rays
Someday it will light us up
And the world will bestow bliss.
Indignation, regret,
For the good, pure love
And glory is a sweet torment
His blood was stirred early.
He and lyra traveled the world;
Under the sky of Schiller and Goethe
Their poetic fire
The soul was ignited in him;
And the muses of sublime art,
Lucky man, he did not shame:
He proudly preserved in the songs
Always lofty feelings,
Impulses of a virgin dream
And the beauty of important simplicity.
He sang love, obedient to love,
And his song was clear,
Like the thoughts of a simple-minded virgin,
Like a baby's dream, like the moon
In the serene deserts of the sky,
The goddess of secrets and gentle sighs.
He sang separation and sadness,
And something, and a vague distance,
And romantic roses;
He sang those faraway countries,
Where is it long in the bosom of silence
His living tears flowed;
He sang the faded color of life
Almost at the age of eighteen.
In the desert, where Eugene is alone
Could appreciate his gifts,
The lords of the neighboring villages
He didn't like feasts.;
He ran away from their noisy conversation.
Their conversation is reasonable
About haymaking, about wine,
About the kennel, about his family,
Of course, he did not shine with any feeling,
Not with poetic fire,
Neither sharpness nor intelligence,
No art dorms;
But the conversation of their lovely wives
He was much less intelligent.
Rich, handsome, Lensky
He was accepted everywhere as a groom;
This is the village custom;
All the daughters were expecting their own
For a semi-Russian neighbor;
Will he rise, immediately the conversation
Gets the word sideways
About the boredom of a single life;
The neighbor is called to the samovar,
And Dunya pours tea;
They whisper to her:
Then they bring a guitar:
And she will squeak (my God!):
Come to my golden hall!..
But Lensky, of course, did not have,
Hunting the bonds of marriage are not enough,
I wished to meet Onegin cordially
Make acquaintance shorter.
They got together. Wave and Stone,
Poetry and prose, ice and fire
They are not so different from each other.
First, by mutual disagreement
They were boring each other.;
Then they liked it; then
We rode together every day
And soon they became inseparable.
So people (I'm the first to repent)
There's nothing to do, friends.
But there is no friendship between us either.
All prejudices have been eliminated,
We honor everyone with zeros,
And units of themselves.
We're all looking at the Napoleons.;
There are millions of bipedal creatures
There is only one weapon for us;
The feeling is wild and funny to us.
Eugene was more tolerable than many;
Although he knew people, of course
And generally despised them,
But (there are no rules without exceptions)
He was very different from others
And he respected that feeling too.
He listened to Lensky with a smile.
The poet's passionate conversation,
And the mind is still shaky in its judgments,
And an eternally inspired gaze,
Everything was new to Onegin;
He's a chilling word
I tried to keep it in my mouth
And I thought: it's stupid to bother me
To His momentary bliss;
And it's time to come without me;
Let him live for now
May the world believe in perfection;
Let's forgive the fever of youth
And young fever and young delirium.
Everything between them gave rise to disputes
And I was attracted to thinking:
Tribes of the past treaties,
Fruits of science, good and evil,
And age-old prejudices,
And the coffin secrets are fatal,
Fate and life in its own way,
Everything was subject to their judgment.
A poet in the heat of his judgments
I was reading, forgetting myself, meanwhile
Excerpts from northern poems,
And the condescending Eugene,
Although I didn't understand a lot of them,
He listened diligently to the young man.
But more often they were occupied by passions
The minds of my hermits.
Gone from their rebellious power,
Onegin talked about them
With an involuntary sigh of regret:
Blessed is He who has known their agitation
And finally I got behind them;
Blessed is the one who did not know them,
Who cooled love by separation,
Enmity sometimes
Yawned with friends and with his wife,
Jealous without worrying about the flour,
And grandfather's faithful capital
I didn't trust the treacherous two.
When will we run to the banner
Prudent silence,
When the flame of passion is extinguished,
And they become funny to us
Their wilfulness or impulses
And belated reviews,
The humble are not without difficulty,
We like to listen sometimes
The passions of others are rebellious,
And he moves our hearts.
That's right the old invalid
A diligent ear readily tends to
According to the stories of young moustaches,
He was forgotten in his hut.
But also a fiery youth
Can't hide anything.
Enmity, love, sadness and joy
She's ready to talk.
In love, being considered an invalid,
Onegin listened with an important air,
How, the hearts of a loving confession,
The poet expressed himself;
Your trusting conscience
He was innocently exposing himself.
Eugene found out without difficulty
His love is a younger story,
A story full of feelings,
They have not been new to us for a long time.
Ah, he loved, as in our summers
No longer love; as one
The mad soul of a poet
I'm still condemned to love:
Always, everywhere there is one dream,
One habitual wish,
One habitual sadness.
No cooling distance,
No long summers of separation,
Not to the muses of this watch,
No foreign beauties,
No noise of fun, no science
The souls have not changed in him,
Warmed by a virgin fire.
A little boy, captured by Olga,
I haven 't known heartache yet,
He was an affectionate witness
Her infant amusements;
In the shade of a protective oak grove
He shared her fun,
And crowns were predicted for the children
Friends are neighbors, their fathers.
In the wilderness, under the shadow of a humble,
Innocent charm is full,
In the eyes of her parents, she
Bloomed like a hidden lily of the valley,
The unknown in the grass is deaf
Neither moths nor bees.
She gave it to the poet
The first dream of young delights,
And the thought of her inspired
His handlebars made the first moan.
Sorry, the games are golden!
He loved the thick groves,
Privacy, silence,
And the night, and the stars, and the moon,
The moon, the heavenly lamp,
To which we dedicated
Walking in the middle of the evening darkness,
And tears, secret torments are a joy
But now we see only in it
Replacement of dim lights.
Always humble, always obedient,
Always as cheerful as the morning,
How the life of a poet is simple-minded,
How is the kiss of love sweet;
Eyes like the sky, blue,
Smile, flaxen curls,
Movements, voice, light stance,
Everything is in Olga, but any novel
Take it and find it right
Her portrait: he is very nice,
I used to love him myself,
But I'm tired of him immensely.
Allow me, my reader,
To take care of the older sister.
Her sister's name was Tatiana
For the first time with such a name
The gentle pages of the novel
We will wilfully sanctify.
And what about it? it is pleasant, sonorous;
But with him, I know, it is inseparable
An old memory
Or a girl's! We all have to
To admit: the taste is very little
With us and in our names
(Not to mention poems);
Enlightenment is not appropriate for us,
And we got it from him.
Affectation, nothing more.
So, her name was Tatiana.
Not her sister's beauty,
Neither by the freshness of her rosy
It would not have attracted the eyes.
Wild, sad, silent,
How timid is the doe of the forest,
She's in her own family
She seemed like a stranger to the girl.
She couldn't make out
To his father, not to his mother;
The child herself, in a crowd of children
I didn't want to play or jump
And often alone all day
She sat silently by the window.
Thoughtfulness, her friend
From the most lullaby days,
The current of rural leisure
I decorated her with dreams.
Her pampered fingers
They did not know needles; leaning on an embroidery frame,
With a silk pattern, she
She did not enliven the canvases.
Hunting to rule is a sign,
With an obedient doll child
It is being prepared jokingly
To the decency of the law of light,
And importantly repeats to her
My mother's lessons.
But dolls even in these years
Tatiana did not take it in her hands;
About the news of the city, about fashion
I didn't have a conversation with her.
And there were childish pranks
Alien to her: scary stories
In winter in the dark of the nights
They captivated her heart more.
When did the nanny collect
For Olga on a wide meadow
All her little friends,
She didn't play with the burners,
She was also bored by the ringing laughter,
And the noise of their windy pleasures.
She loved on the balcony
To warn the dawn sunrise,
When in the pale sky
The dance of stars disappears,
And quietly the edge of the earth brightens,
And, herald of the morning, the wind blows,
And the day gradually rises.
In winter, when the night shadow
Half the world has a share,
And a share in idle silence,
With a clouded moon,
The lazy East is resting,
Awakened at the usual hour
She got up by candlelight.
She liked novels early on;
They replaced everything for her;
She fell in love with deceptions
And Richardson and Rousseau.
Her father was a kind fellow,
In the last century, the belated;
But I didn't see any harm in books;
He, without ever reading,
He considered them an empty toy
And I didn't care about that,
What a secret tom my daughter
Had Dozed off under her pillow until morning.
His wife was herself
I'm crazy about Richardson.
She loved Richardson.
Not because I read it.,
Not because Grandison
She preferred Lovelace;
But in the old days, Princess Alina,
Her Moscow cousin,
I often told her about them.
There was also a groom at that time
Her husband, but in captivity;
She sighed for another,
Who is with his heart and mind
She liked him much more:
This Grandison was a nice dandy,
A gambler and a sergeant of the guards.
How was she dressed
Always in fashion and to the face;
But without asking her advice,
The Girl was taken to the wedding.
And to dispel her grief,
The sensible husband left soon after
To her village, where she,
God knows who she's surrounded by,
I was torn and cried at first,
I almost divorced my husband;
Then I took care of the household,
I got used to it and became satisfied.
Habit is given to us from above:
It is a substitute for happiness.
Habit has soothed grief,
Not reflected by anything;
The opening is big soon
She was completely comforted:
She is between business and leisure
I discovered the secret as a spouse
To govern autocratically,
And then everything started to get better.
She went to work,
Salted mushrooms for the winter,
She kept expenses, shaved foreheads,
I went to the bathhouse on Saturdays,
She beat the maids angrily
All this without asking my husband.
I used to pee in blood
She's in the albums of gentle maidens,
She called Polina Praskovya
And she spoke in a singsong voice,
She wore a very narrow corset,
And Russian is like French
She could pronounce it through her nose;
But soon everything changed:
Corset, album, Princess Alina,
Sensitive poems notebook
She forgot: she started calling
The shark of the old Selina
And finally updated
There is a dressing gown and a cap on the cotton wool.
But her husband loved her cordially,
It wasn't part of her plan,
He believed in everything blithely,
And he ate and drank in his dressing gown;
His life went on peacefully;
In the evening, sometimes they converged
Neighbors are a kind family,
Inconsiderate friends,
And to harass, and to curse,
And laugh about something.
Time passes; meanwhile
Olga will be ordered to make tea,
There's dinner, it's time to sleep there,
And the guests are coming from the courtyard.
They kept it in a peaceful life
The habits of the dear old;
They have a fat carnival
There were Russian pancakes;
Twice a year they talked;
They loved round swings,
There are songs, a round dance;
On the day of Trinity, when the people,
Yawning, listen to the prayer service,
Sweetly on the beam of dawn
They shed tears three times;
They needed kvass like air,
And they have guests at the table
They carried dishes according to rank.
And so they both aged.
And finally they opened
In front of the spouse of the coffin door,
And he took a new crown.
He died an hour before dinner,
Mourned by his neighbor,
Children and faithful wife
More sincere than the other.
He was a simple and kind gentleman,
And where his ashes lie,
The tombstone reads:
The Humble Sinner, Dmitry Larin,
The Lord's slave and foreman,
Under the stone, this one tastes peace.
Returned to his penates,
Vladimir Lensky visited
The neighbor's monument is humble,
And he dedicated a sigh to the ashes;
And for a long time my heart was sad.
He held me in his arms.
How often did I play as a child
His Ochakov medal!
He was expecting Olga for me.,
He said: will I wait for the day?..
And full of sincere sadness,
Vladimir immediately wrote
He has a tombstone madrigal.
And there is also a sad inscription
Father and mother, in tears,
He honored the patriarchal ashes
Alas! on the reins of life
The instant harvest of a generation,
By the secret will of providence,
They rise, mature and fall;
Others follow them
So our windy tribe
It grows, worries, boils
And the great-grandfathers are crowding towards the coffin.
Our time will come, our time will come,
And our grandchildren in a good hour
We will also be ousted from the world!
Revel in it for now,
Have an easy life, friends!
I mean her insignificance
And I'm not attached to her much.;
I closed my eyes to the ghosts;
But distant hopes
They disturb the heart sometimes:
Without an inconspicuous trace
I would be sad to leave the world.
I do not live and write for praise;
But I think I would like to
To glorify your sad lot,
To take care of me like a faithful friend,
It reminded me of at least one sound.
And he will touch someone's heart.;
And, saved by fate,
Maybe it won't sink in the Summer
The stanza composed by me;
Perhaps (a flattering hope!),
The future ignoramus will indicate
To my famous portrait
And he says: that was a poet!
Please accept my thanks,
A fan of peaceful aonides,
O you, whose memory will preserve
My flying creations,
Whose benevolent hand
He'll rub the old man's laurels!
Goodbye, Onegin, I have to go.
But where are you
Do you spend your evenings?
That's wonderful.
Have mercy! And it's not difficult for you
Is there a killing every night?
I can't understand it.
Now I see what it is:
First of all (listen, am I right?),
A simple, Russian family,
There is great zeal for the guests,
Jam, eternal conversation
About the rain, about flax, about the barnyard
I don't see any trouble here yet.
The home circle is dearer to me,
Where can I find an eclogue!
Come on, honey, for God's sake.
Well? You're going: it's a pity.
Oh, listen, Lensky; but you can't
To see this Phyllida for me,
The subject of both thoughts and pen,
And tears and rhymes et cetera?..
Introduce me.
Even now.
They will gladly accept us.
Let's go.
Others galloped off,
They appeared; they were wasted
Sometimes difficult services
Hospitable antiquity.
The rite of famous treats:
They carry jam on saucers,
They put a waxed one on the table
A jug of cranberry water.
They are the most expensive of the briefest
They're flying home at full speed.
Now let's eavesdrop stealthily
The heroes of our conversation:
But you miss me
You're bigger somehow. No, it's the same.
However, it's too dark in the field;
Hurry up! Go, go, Andrew!
What stupid places!
And by the way: Larina is simple,
But a very sweet old lady;
I'm afraid: lingonberry water
She wouldn't hurt me.
Tell me: which one is Tatiana?
Yes, the one who is sad
And silent, like Svetlana,
She came in and sat by the window.
I would have chosen another one.,
If only I were like you, a poet.
Olga has no life in her features.
Just like in the Vandik's Madonna:
She is round, her face is red,
Like this stupid moon
In this stupid sky.
Vladimir replied dryly
And then he was silent the whole way.
Meanwhile, Onegin's appearance
The Larins produced
Everyone is very impressed
And all the neighbors were entertained.
Guess after guess went on.
Everyone began to interpret furtively,
Joking, judging is not without sin,
Tatiana is expecting a groom;
Others even claimed,
That the wedding is completely coordinated,
But then it was stopped,
That they didn't get fashionable rings.
About Lensky's wedding a long time ago
They had already decided.
Tatiana listened with annoyance
Such gossip; but secretly
With inexplicable joy
I couldn't help thinking about that;
And the thought sank into my heart;
It's time, she fell in love.
So the fallen grain falls into the ground
Spring is enlivened by fire.
It's been a long time since her imagination,
Burning with longing and longing,
The thirst for food is fatal;
It's been a long time since a heartache
Her younger breasts were cramped;
The soul was waiting for someone,
And I waited
She said: It's him!
Alas! Now it's days and nights,
And a hot lonely dream,
Everything is full of them; everything is sweet to the virgin
Incessantly with magical power
Keeps talking about him. Bothering her
And the sounds of gentle speeches,
And the gaze of a caring servant.
She is plunged into despondency,
She doesn't listen to the guests
And curses their leisure time,
Their unexpected arrival
And a long sitting.
Now what kind of attention is she paying
Reading a sweet novel,
With what lively charm
Drinking a seductive deception!
With the happy power of dreaming
Animated creatures,
Julia Volmar's lover,
Malek-Adele and de Linard,
And Werther, the rebellious martyr,
And the incomparable Grandison,
Which makes us sleepy,
Everything for a gentle dreamer
They put on a single image,
They merged into one Onegin.
Imagining herself to be a heroine?
Of her beloved creators,
Clarice, Julia, Delphine,
Tatiana in the silence of the woods
One wanders with a dangerous book,
She searches for it and finds it
Your secret heat, your dreams,
The fruits of the fullness of the heart,
Sighs and appropriates to himself
Someone else's delight, someone else's sadness,
Into oblivion he whispers by heart
A letter for a sweet hero
But our hero, whoever he is,
It certainly wasn't Grandison.
Your own style in an important mood,
He used to be a fiery creator
He showed us his hero
As a model of perfection.
He gifted a favorite subject,
Always unjustly persecuted,
With a sensitive soul, with a mind
And an attractive face.
Feeding the heat of the purest passion,
Always an enthusiastic hero
I was ready to sacrifice myself,
And at the end of the last part
Vice has always been punished,
A wreath was worthy of kindness.
And now all minds are in a fog,
Morality makes us sleepy,
Vice is amiable in the novel too,
And there he triumphs.
The British Muse is a tall tale
They disturb the sleep of the adolescent,
And now he has become her idol
Or a brooding Vampire,
Or Melmoth, the gloomy tramp,
Or the Eternal Jew, or the Corsair,
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Lord Byron by a lucky whim
Clothed in a dull romanticism
And hopeless selfishness.
My friends, what's the use of that?
Perhaps by the will of heaven,
I will stop being a poet.,
I'm going to be possessed by a new demon,
And, Phoebe's defying threats,
I will stoop to humble prose;
Then the novel is in the old way
It will take my merry sunset.
Not the torments of secret villainy
I will portray it menacingly,
But I'll just tell you about it
The traditions of the Russian family,
Love captivating dreams
Yes, the customs of our antiquity.
I will retell simple speeches
Father or old uncle,
Children's appointments
By the old lime trees, by the stream;
Unhappy jealousy of torment,
Separation, tears of reconciliation,
I'll quarrel again, and finally
I'll lead them down the aisle.
I will remember the speeches of the passionate bliss,
Words of longing love,
Which in days gone by
At the feet of a beautiful mistress
They came to my tongue,
Which I am now unaccustomed to.
Tatiana, dear Tatiana!
I'm crying with you now;
You're in the hands of a fashionable tyrant
I've already given up my fate.
You will perish, my dear; but first
You're in a blaze of hope.
You call the dark bliss,
You will learn the bliss of life,
You drink the magic poison of desires,
You are haunted by dreams:
You imagine everywhere
Happy Dating Shelters;
Everywhere, everywhere in front of you
Your tempter is fatal.
The longing of love drives Tatiana away,
And she goes into the garden to be sad,
And suddenly her eyes are motionless,
And she is too lazy to step further.
Chest lifted, lanita
Instant flame covered,
The breath froze in my mouth,
And there is noise in the hearing, and a sparkle in the eyes
Night will come; the moon is going around
The watch of the distant vault of heaven,
And the nightingale in the darkness of the trees
The melodies are sonorous.
Tatiana does not sleep in the dark
And he speaks quietly to the nanny:
I can't sleep, Nanny: it's so stuffy in here!
Open the window and sit down with me.
I am bored,
Let's talk about the old days.
What is it about, Tanya? I used to,
I kept a lot of things in my memory
Old stories, tall tales
About evil spirits and about girls;
And now everything is dark for me, Tanya:
I forgot what I knew. Yes,
A bad turn has come!
Tell me about it, Nanny,
About your old years:
Were you in love then?
And, come on, Tanya! These summers
We haven't heard about love;
Otherwise, she would have driven me out of the world
My dead mother-in-law.
God must have ordered it that way. My Vanya
He was younger than me, my light,
And I was thirteen years old.
The matchmaker went for two weeks
To my family, and finally
My father blessed me.
I cried bitterly out of fear,
They unwound my braid crying
Yes, they took me to church with a stump.
And so they introduced a stranger into the family
You're not listening to me.
Oh, nanny, nanny, I'm longing,
I feel sick, my dear:
I'm ready to cry, I'm ready to cry!..
God have mercy and save us!
What do you want, ask
Let me sprinkle with holy water,
You're not sick at all:
I am.
And babysitter the girl with a plea
She baptized with an old hand.
Whispered again
To the old woman with grief she is.
Dear friend, you are not well.
And meanwhile the moon was shining
And lit up with a languid light
Tatiana's pale beauties,
And loose hair,
And drops of tears, and on the bench
Before the young heroine,
With a kerchief on his head, gray-haired,
An old woman in a long padded jacket;
And everything was dozing in silence
Under the inspiring moon.
And her heart was far away
Tatiana, looking at the moon
Suddenly a thought was born in her mind
Go on, leave me alone.
Give me a pen, a paper, nanny,
Yes, move the table; I'll go to bed soon;
Sorry. And here she is alone.
Everything is quiet. The moon is shining on her.
Leaning on her elbows, Tatiana writes,
And everything is on Eugene's mind,
And in a thoughtless letter
The love of an innocent virgin breathes.
The letter is ready, folded
Tatiana! Who is it for?
I knew beauties who were inaccessible,
Cold, clean, like winter,
Implacable, incorruptible,
Incomprehensible to the mind;
I marveled at their fashionable arrogance,
Their natural virtues,
And, I admit, I ran away from them,
And, I think, I read with horror
Above their eyebrows is the inscription of hell:
Give up hope forever.
Inspiring love is a disaster for them,
Scaring people is a joy for them.
Perhaps on the banks of the Neva
You have seen similar ladies.
Among the fans of the obedient
I've seen other freaks,
Selfishly indifferent
For passionate sighs and praises.
And what did I find with amazement?
They, by stern command
Scaring timid love,
They were able to attract her again
At least with regret,
At least the sound of the speeches
Sometimes he seemed more gentle,
And with a gullible dazzle
A young lover again
I was running after a nice fuss.
For what is Tatiana more guilty?
For the fact that in sweet simplicity
She knows no deception
And does he believe in his chosen dream?
For the fact that he loves without art,
Obedient to the attraction of feeling,
That she is so trusting,
That she is gifted from heaven
A rebellious imagination,
With a living mind and will,
And a wayward head,
And with a fiery and tender heart?
Don't you forgive her
Are you frivolous of passions?
The coquette judges in cold blood,
Tatiana loves without joking
And it is certainly committed
Love, like a sweet child.
She does not say: let's postpone
We will multiply the price of love,
Or rather, we'll start it online;
First, let's prick the vanity
Hope, there is perplexity
We will torment the heart, and then
We will revive it with Jealous fire;
And then, bored with pleasure,
The slave is cunning from the shackles
I'm ready to break out every hour.
I also foresee difficulties:
Saving the honor of the native land,
I will undoubtedly
Have to translate Tatiana's letter.
She didn't speak Russian well.,
I haven't read our magazines
And he expressed himself with difficulty
In your native language,
So, I wrote in French
What to do! I repeat again:
Until now, ladies' love
I didn't explain myself in Russian,
Our language is still proud
I'm not used to postal prose.
I know: they want to force the ladies
Read in Russian. Really, fear!
Can I imagine them
With in hand!
I'm falling for you, my poets;
Isn't it true: cute objects,
To whom, for their sins,
Did you write poetry in secret,
To whom the heart was dedicated,
Isn't everything in Russian
Owning weakly and with difficulty,
It was so sweetly distorted,
And in their mouths the language is foreign
Have you turned to your native one?
God forbid I get together at the ball
Or when driving on the porch
With a seminarian in a yellow chalet
Or with an academician in a cap!
Like rosy lips without a smile,
Without a grammatical error
I don't like Russian speech.
Perhaps to my misfortune,
There are new generation of beauties,
Magazines heeding the pleading voice,
It will teach us grammar;
Poems will be put into use;
But what do I care?
I will be faithful to the old days.
Incorrect, careless babbling,
Inaccurate pronunciation of speeches
Still a heart flutter
They will produce it in my chest;
I have no strength to repent,
Gallicisms will be nice to me,
Like the sins of the past youth,
Like Bogdanovich's poems.
But enough is enough. It's time for me to get busy
By the letter of my beauty;
I gave my word, so what? By God
Now I'm ready to give up.
I know: Gentle Guys
The pen is not in fashion these days.
The singer of Feasts and languid sadness,
If you were still with me,
I would have made an immodest request.
To disturb you, my dear:
To the magic tunes
You shifted the passionate virgin
Foreign words.
Where are you? Come: your rights
I give it to you with a bow
But in the midst of sad rocks,
Weaning our hearts from praise,
Alone, under the Finnish sky,
He wanders, and his soul
He does not hear my grief.
Tatiana's letter is in front of me;
I cherish it sacredly,
I read with secret longing
And I can't read enough.
Who inspired her with this tenderness too,
And words of amiable negligence?
Who inspired her with tender nonsense,
Crazy heart talk,
And fascinating and harmful?
I can't understand. But here
Incomplete, weak translation,
From the tableau, the list is pale
Or a staged Freischitz
Through the fingers of timid students:
Tatiana's letter to Onegin
I'm writing to you, what's more?
What else can I say?
Now, I know, in your will
To punish me with contempt.
But you, to my unfortunate lot
Keeping at least a drop of pity,
You won't leave me.
At first I wanted to be silent;
Believe me: my shame
You would never know,
When would I have had hope
At least rarely, at least once a week
To see you in our village,
Just to hear your speeches,
Say a word to you, and then
Keep thinking, thinking about one thing
And day and night until we meet again.
But they say you are unsociable;
In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,
And we don't shine with anything,
Even though we are innocently glad to see you.
Why did you visit us?
In the wilderness of a forgotten village
I would never have known you,
I would not know the bitter torment.
Souls of inexperienced excitement
Having come to terms with time (who knows?),
I would have found a friend according to my heart,
There would be a faithful spouse
And a virtuous mother.
The other one!.. No, no one in the world
I would not give my heart!
That in the Highest is destined to be the council
It is the will of heaven: I am yours;
My whole life has been a pledge
Goodbye faithful to you;
I know you were sent to me by God.,
You are my guardian to the grave
You appeared to me in my dreams
Invisible, you were too sweet to me,
Your wonderful look tormented me,
Your voice sounded in my soul
Not for a long time, it wasn't a dream!
You came in a little bit, I found out in a moment,
She was all stunned and flushed
And in my mind I said: Here he is!
Isn't it true? I've heard you:
You spoke to me in silence,
When I helped the poor
Or she delighted me with prayer
The longing of a troubled soul?
And at this very moment
Isn't that you, sweet vision,
In the transparent darkness, he flashed,
Clung quietly to the headboard?
Not you, with joy and love,
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
Who are you, my guardian angel,
Or an insidious tempter:
Resolve my doubts.
Maybe it's all empty,
The deception of an inexperienced soul!
And it is destined to be completely different
But so be it! My fate
From now on, I'm handing you,
I'm crying in front of you,
For your protection, please
Imagine: I'm here alone,
No one understands me,
My mind is exhausted,
And I have to die in silence.
I'm waiting for you: with one eye
Revive the hopes of the heart
Or a heavy dream break,
Alas, a well-deserved reproach!
I'm coming! It's scary to reread
I freeze with shame and fear
But I'm on bail, Your Honor.,
And I boldly entrust myself to her
Tatiana will sigh, then gasp;
The letter trembles in her hand;
The pink wafer is drying
On an inflamed tongue.
She leaned her head to his shoulder,
The light shirt came down
From her lovely shoulder
But that's the moonbeam
The glow goes out. There's a valley there
It's getting clearer through the steam. There's a stream
Silvered; there's a horn
The shepherd wakes up the villager.
Here's the morning: everyone got up a long time ago,
My Tatiana doesn't care.
She does not notice the dawn,
She sits with a drooping head
And he doesn't press the letter
Its seal is cut-out.
But, quietly unlocking the door,
Oh, she's a gray-haired Filipyevna
He brings tea on a tray.
It's time, my child, get up:
Yes, you're ready, beautiful!
Oh, my early bird!
I was so afraid!
Yes, thank God, you're healthy!
There is no trace of night melancholy,
Your face is like the color of poppies.
But you see
So, let's go quietly grandson
With this note to O
To the neighbor and tell him to,
Don't let him say a word.,
So that he doesn't call me
To whom, my dear?
I've become clueless now.
There are a lot of neighbors around;
Where should I read them?
Dear friend, I'm too old,
She's old; her mind is getting dull, Tanya;
Otherwise, I used to be very,
Sometimes, the word of the lord's will
Oh, nanny, nanny! Before that?
What do I need in your mind?
You see, the case of the letter
To Onegin. Well, business, business.
Don't be angry, my soul,
You know, I'm not clear
Why are you turning pale again?
So, Nanny, it's really nothing.
Send your grandson.
But the day has passed, and there is no answer.
The other one has come: everything is not as it is not.
Pale as a shadow, dressed in the morning,
Tatiana is waiting: when is the answer?
Olga's admirer has arrived.
He had a question from the hostess.
He's completely forgotten us.
Tatiana flushed and trembled.
Lensky replied to the old woman,
Yes, it was obvious that the mail was delayed.
Tatiana lowered her gaze,
As if hearing an angry rebuke.
It was getting dark; on the table, shining,
The evening samovar hissed,
Chinese kettle heating;
A light steam was billowing under it.
Spilled by Olga's hand,
Through the cups with a dark stream
The fragrant tea was already running,
And the boy served cream;
Tatiana was standing in front of the window,
On the cold panes breathing,
Thinking, my soul,
She wrote with a lovely finger
On the foggy glass
The cherished monogram Oh yes e.
And yet her soul ached,
And the languid gaze was full of tears.
Suddenly there's a stomp!.. Her blood froze.
That's closer! They also jump into the yard
Eugene! And lighter than a shadow
Tatiana jumped into the other hall,
From the porch to the yard, and straight into the garden,
Flying, flying; take a look back
She doesn't dare; she ran around in a flash
Curtains, bridges, lawn,
The alley to the lake, the forest,
I broke the lilac bushes,
Flying through the flower beds to the stream.
And, panting, onto the bench
Fell
He's here! Eugene is here!
Oh my God! What did he think!
She has a heart full of torment,
Keeps the hopes of a dark dream;
She is trembling and bursting with heat,
And he waits: will it come? But he doesn't hear it.
In the maid's garden, on the ridges,
Picking berries in the bushes
And they sang in chorus according to the order
(A punishment based on,
So that the lord's berries are secretly
The evil mouth did not eat
And they were busy singing:
The idea of rural witticism!)
The song of the girls
Girls, beauties,
Dear friends, dear friends,
Play it out girls,
Take a walk, dear ones!
Tighten up the song,
A cherished song,
Lure the young man
To our round dance,
How to lure a good fellow,
As we see from afar,
Let's run away, dear ones,
Sprinkle with cherries,
Cherries, raspberries,
Red currant.
Don't go eavesdropping
Cherished songs,
Don't go peeping
Our games are girlish.
They sing, and, with carelessness
Listening to their sonorous voice,
Tatiana was waiting impatiently,
So that the flutter of her heart would subside,
To make the burning go away.
But there is the same trembling in the Persians,
And the fever does not go away.,
But brighter, brighter it just burns
That's how the poor moth shines
And it beats with a rainbow wing,
Captured by a schoolboy prankster;
So the bunny in the winter trembles,
Suddenly seeing from afar
Into the bushes of the fallen shooter.
But finally she sighed
And she got up from her bench;
I went, but I just turned around
Into the alley, right in front of her,
Shining eyes, Eugene
It stands like a menacing shadow,
And, as if burned by fire,
She stopped.
But the consequences of an unexpected meeting
Today, dear friends,
I can't retell it.;
I have to after a long speech
And take a walk and relax:
I'll finish it after sometime.
The less we love a woman,
The easier it is for her to like us
And the more likely we destroy it
In the midst of seductive networks.
Debauchery used to be cold-blooded
He was famous for his love life,
Trumpeting about himself everywhere
And enjoying without loving.
But this is important fun
Worthy of old monkeys
The vaunted grandfather's time:
Lovelace's dilapidated glory
With the glory of red heels
And stately wigs.
Who is not bored with hypocrisy,
It is different to repeat one thing,
It is important to try to assure that,
What has everyone been sure of for a long time,
All the same to hear objections,
Destroy preconceptions,
Which were not and are not
A girl at the age of thirteen!
Who won't get tired of threats,
Prayers, vows, imaginary fear,
Notes on six sheets,
Deceptions, gossip, rings, tears,
Supervision of aunts, mothers
And the friendship of hard husbands!
That's exactly what my Eugene thought.
He is in his first youth
He was a victim of violent delusions
And unbridled passions.
Spoiled by the habit of life,
I am temporarily fascinated by one,
Disappointed by the other,
We slowly languish in desire,
Languishing and windy success,
Listening in the noise and in the silence
Eternal murmuring of the soul,
Suppressing yawns with laughter:
That's how he killed eight years,
The loss of life is the best color.
He no longer fell in love with beauties,
Did you drag yourself around somehow;
They will refuse
Change was glad to have a rest.
He searched for them without enthusiasm,
And he left them without regret,
Barely remembering their love and anger.
That's right, an indifferent guest
He arrives at evening whist,
Sits down; the game is over:
He's leaving the yard,
He falls asleep quietly at home
And he doesn't know himself in the morning,
Where he's going in the evening.
But after receiving Tanya's message,
Onegin was vividly touched:
The language of girlish dreams
In it, the thoughts were outraged by a swarm;
And he remembered Tatiana Mila
And the color is pale and the appearance is dull;
And into a sweet, sinless sleep
He was immersed in his soul.
Perhaps the feeling is old-fashioned
He was possessed for a moment;
But he didn't want to cheat
The credulity of an innocent soul.
Now we're going to fly to the garden,
Where Tatiana met him.
They were silent for two minutes,
But Onegin came up to her
And he said: You wrote to me,
Don't deny it. I read it
The soul of a trusting confession,
Innocent outpouring of love;
I like your sincerity;
She made me nervous.
Long-silenced feelings;
But I don't want to praise you.;
I'll pay you back for it.
Recognition is also without art;
Accept my confession:
I'm giving myself up to you for judgment.
When would life be a domestic circle
I wanted to limit it;
When would I be a father, a spouse
A pleasant lot commanded;
When would it be a family picture
I was captivated at least for a moment.,
That's right, except for you alone
No one else was looking for a bride.
I will say without the madrigal sequins:
Having found my former ideal,
I probably would have chosen you alone.
As a friend of my sad days,
All the best as a pledge,
And I would be as happy as I could!
But I'm not made for bliss.;
My soul is alien to him;
Your perfections are in vain:
I am not worthy of them at all.
Believe me (conscience is a guarantee),
Marriage will be a torment to us.
No matter how much I love you,
Once I get used to it, I'll fall out of love immediately;
You will start crying: your tears
They will not touch my heart,
And they will only infuriate him.
Judge what kind of roses
Hymenaeus will prepare for us
And maybe for many days.
What could be worse in the world
Families with a poor wife
Sad about an unworthy husband,
Both in the afternoon and in the evening alone;
Where is the boring husband, knowing her value
(Fate, however, cursing),
Always frowning, silent,
Angry and coldly jealous!
That's me. And that's what they were looking for
You are a pure, fiery soul,
When with such simplicity,
Have you written to me with such intelligence?
Is this your lot
Appointed by a strict fate?
There is no return to dreams and years;
I will not renew my soul
I love you with the love of a brother
And maybe even more gently.
Listen to me without anger:
The younger maiden will replace me more than once
Dreams are easy dreams;
So the tree has its own leaves
It changes every spring.
So it is clearly destined by heaven.
You will love again: but
Learn to control yourself;
Not everyone will understand you like me.;
Inexperience leads to trouble.
That's how Eugene preached.
Through tears without seeing anything,
Barely breathing,
Tatiana listened to him without protest.
He held out his hand to her. Sadly
(As they say, mechanically)
Tatiana silently leaned on,
With a languid head bowing;
Let's go home around the garden;
They came together, and no one
I didn't try to blame them for that.
Rural freedom has
Your lucky rights,
So is arrogant Moscow.
You will agree, my reader,
Which is very nice.
With sad Tanya, our friend;
It's not the first time he's shown up here
Souls are direct nobility,
Although people are unwilling
Nothing was spared in him:
His enemies, his friends
(Which may be the same thing)
He was reviled this way and that.
Everyone in the world has enemies,
But God save us from our friends!
These are my friends, my friends!
I remembered them for a reason.
And what? Just like that. I'm putting you to sleep
Empty, black dreams;
I only notice in parentheses,
That there is no despicable slander,
In the attic, born a liar
And the secular rabble encouraged,
That there is no such nonsense,
No areal epigrams,
Which would be your friend with a smile,
In a circle of decent people,
Without any malice and tricks,
I didn't repeat it a hundred times by mistake;
However, he is a mountain for you:
He loves you so much like a native!
Hm! Hm! The reader is noble,
Is your whole family healthy?
Allow me: maybe you want to
Now you need to find out from me,
Which means exactly relatives.
Native people are like that:
We have to caress them,
To love, to respect mentally
And, according to the custom of the people,
About Christmas to visit them
Or send congratulations by mail,
So that the rest of the year
They didn't think about us.
So, God grant them long days!
But the love of gentle beauties
Is more reliable than friendship and kinship:
Above her and in the midst of rebellious storms
You retain your rights.
Of course it is. But the whirlwind of fashion,
But the waywardness of nature,
But the opinions of the secular stream
And the cute floor is light as a feather.
Besides, the opinions of the spouse
For a virtuous wife
They should always be honored;
So your faithful friend
Sometimes she is instantly carried away:
Satan is joking with love.
Who should I love? Who should I believe?
Who won't cheat on us alone?
Who measures all deeds, all speeches
Is it helpful for our yard?
Who is not spreading slander about us?
Who cares about us?
Who cares about our vice?
Who will never get bored?
The ghost is a vain seeker,
Labors in vain without ruining,
Love yourself,
My dear reader!
The subject is worthy: nothing
He's probably not nicer.
What was the consequence of the date?
Alas, it is not difficult to guess!
Love is crazy suffering
They didn 't stop worrying
A young soul, a greedy sorrow;
No, more than a joyless passion
Poor Tatiana is on fire;
Sleep is running in her bed;
Health, life color and sweetness,
Smile, virgin peace,
Everything is gone that the sound is empty,
And sweet Tanya's youth pales:
That's how the shadow dresses the storms
A barely born day.
Alas, Tatiana is fading,
It turns pale, goes out and is silent!
Nothing interests her,
She doesn't move her soul.
Shaking his head importantly,
The neighbors are whispering among themselves:
It's time, it's time for her to get married!..
But come on. I need to hurry up
To amuse the imagination
A picture of happy love.
Involuntarily, my dears,
I'm embarrassed by regret;
Forgive me: I love it so much
My dear Tatiana!
From hour to hour the captive is more
The beauties of Olga the young,
Vladimir sweet captivity
I gave myself up with a full soul.
He's always with her. In her peace
Two of them are sitting in the dark;
They are in the garden, hand in hand,
Walking in the morning;
And what about it? Intoxicated with love,
In the confusion of tender shame,
He only dares sometimes,
Olga's smile is encouraging,
Play with a developed curl
Or kiss the edge of your clothes.
He sometimes reads to Ole
A moral novel,
In which the author knows more
Nature than Chateaubriand,
Meanwhile, two, three pages
(Empty nonsense, tall tales,
Dangerous for the heart of virgins)
He skips, blushing.
Getting away from everyone far away,
They are above the chessboard,
Leaning on the table, sometimes
They sit deep in thought,
And Lensky pawns the rook
He takes his own in distraction.
Will he go home, and at home
He's busy with his Olga.
Flying album Sheets
Diligently decorates it:
Then in them he paints rural views,
A tombstone, the temple of Cypress,
Or a dove on the lyre
With a pen and paints slightly;
That's on the memory sheets
Lower than the signatures of others
He leaves a gentle verse,
A silent monument of dreaming,
A momentary thought, a long trail,
Still the same after many years.
Of course, you've seen it more than once
County young ladies album,
That all the girlfriends are dirty
From the end, from the beginning and all around.
Here, to spite the spelling,
Poems without measure, according to tradition
As a sign of friendship, the faithful have been introduced,
Reduced, continued.
On the first leaf you meet
Quecrrez-ous sur ces tabettes,
And the signature: T. A. Annette;
And on the last one you will read:
Who loves more than you,
Let him write further than me.
Here you will certainly find
Two hearts, a torch and flowers;
That's right, you'll read the vows
In love to the grave;
Some kind of army pete
Then a villainous rhyme came up.
In such an album, my friends,
I must admit, I am glad to write too,
I'm sure being a soul,
That all my zealous nonsense
He will earn a favorable look
And then what happens with an evil smile
It will not be important to disassemble,
Acutely or not, I could have lied.
But you, the disparate volumes
From the library of devils,
Great albums,
The torment of fashionable rhymers,
You, decorated nimbly
Tolstoy with a miraculous brush
Or Baratynsky's pen,
May God's thunder burn you!
When the brilliant lady
He gives me his n-quarto,
And trembling and anger takes me away,
And the epigram moves
In the depths of my soul,
And write them madrigals!
Lensky does not write madrigals
In Olga Molodoy's album;
His pen breathes love,
Does not coolly shine with sharpness;
Whatever he notices or hears
About Olga, he writes about
It: And, full of living truth,
Elegies flow like a river.
So you are inspired by Languages,
In the impulses of his heart,
Sing God knows who,
And the precious set of elegies
You don't have time to imagine
The whole story of your fate.
But hush! Do you hear? The critic is strict
Commands us to reset
Elegies are a miserable wreath,
And our rhyming brothers
Screaming: Yes, stop crying,
And it's all the same croaking,
Regretting the old, about the past:
Enough, sing about something else!
You're right, and you'll point us out correctly
A trumpet, a disguise and a dagger,
And thoughts are dead capital
You'll have to resurrect it from everywhere:
Isn't that right, friend? Not at all. Where to!
Write odes, gentlemen,
How they were written in the powerful years,
As it was in the old days
Some solemn odes!
And, come on, friend; does it really matter?
Remember what the satirist said!
The cunning lyricist
Is it more tolerable for you
Our sad rhymers?
Its empty purpose is pathetic;
Meanwhile, the goal of the ode is high
And it would be possible to be noble Here
We can argue, but I'm silent:
I don't want to quarrel for two centuries.
A fan of fame and freedom,
In the excitement of his stormy thoughts,
Vladimir would write odes,
Yes, Olga did not read them.
Have poets ever been tearful
Read into the eyes of your dear ones
Your creations? They say,
That there are no awards in the world above.
And right away, blessed is the humble lover
Who reads his dreams
The subject of songs and love,
The beauty is pleasantly languid!
Blessed though, maybe she is
I am entertained in a completely different way.
But I am the fruit of my dreams
And harmonic ideas
I only read to the old nurse.,
A friend of my youth,
Yes, after a boring lunch
A stray neighbor came to me,
Caught unexpectedly by the floor,
The soul is a tragedy in the corner,
Or (but this is no joke),
Longing and rhyming torment,
Wandering over my lake,
Scaring a herd of wild ducks:
Heeding the singing of mellifluous stanzas,
They fly off the coast.
And what about Onegin? By the way, brothers!
I ask for your patience:
His daily activities
I will describe it to you in detail.
Onegin lived an anchorite:
He got up at seven o'clock in the summer
And he went light
To the river running under the mountain;
Gulnara's singer imitating,
This Hellespont swam,
Then I drank my coffee,
Bad magazine going over,
And he was getting dressed
Walking, reading, deep sleep,
Forest shadow, the murmur of streams,
Sometimes white-eyed
A young and fresh kiss,
The bridle is an obedient and zealous horse,
Lunch is quite whimsical,
A bottle of light wine,
Solitude, silence:
This is Onegin's holy life;
And he's insensitive to her
Indulged in the red summer days
In careless bliss, not counting,
Forgetting the city, and friends,
And the boredom of festive undertakings.
But our northern summer,
A caricature of southern winters,
Will flash and not: it is known,
Although we don't want to admit it.
The sky was breathing in autumn,
The sun shone less often,
The day was getting shorter,
The mysterious canopy of forests
She was getting naked with a sad noise,
Fog lay on the fields,
A caravan of noisy geese
It stretched to the south: it was approaching
It's a pretty boring time;
It was already November at the yard.
The dawn rises in the cold darkness;
In the fields, the noise of work has stopped;
With his hungry wolf
A wolf comes out on the road;
Sensing him, the road horse
The careful traveler also snores
Rushing uphill at full speed;
At the dawn of the shepherd
He doesn't drive the cows out of the barn,
And at the noon hour in a circle
They are not called by his horn;
In the hut, singing, the maiden
Spinning, and, winter friend of the nights,
A splinter crackles in front of her.
And now the frosts are already cracking
And they are silvered in the middle of the fields
(The reader is waiting for the rhyme of the rose;
Here, take it quickly!)
Neater than a fashionable parquet
The river shines, it is clothed with ice.
Boys are a joyful people
Ice skates soundly cuts the ice;
The goose is heavy on red paws,
Having conceived the idea of sailing through the bosom of the waters,
Treads carefully on the ice,
Slides and falls; cheerful
The first snow is flickering, curling,
Stars falling on the breg.
In the wilderness, what to do at this time?
To walk? The village of that time
Unwittingly bothers the eye
Monotonous nudity.
To ride on horseback in the harsh steppe?
But a horse with a blunted horseshoe
The wrong one is hooking the ice,
And that's what you expect to fall.
Sit under a deserted roof,
Read: Here's Pradt, here's W. Scott.
Don't you want to? trust the expense,
Get angry or drink, and the evening is long
How will it go, and tomorrow also,
And you'll have a nice winter.
Direct Onegin Child-Harold
I fell into a thoughtful laziness:
He sits down in an ice bath from sleep,
And after that, at home all day,
Alone, immersed in calculations,
Armed with a blunt cue,
He's on a two-ball pool table
He's been playing since morning.
A rustic evening will come:
Billiards is abandoned, the cue is forgotten,
The table is set in front of the fireplace,
Evgeny is waiting: here comes Lensky
On three roan horses;
Let's have lunch soon!
The Widows of Clicquot or Moet
Blessed wine
In a frozen bottle for a poet
It was brought to the table immediately.
It sparkles and sparkles;
It is with its play and foam
(In the likeness of this)
I was captivated: for him
I used to give the last poor mite. Do you remember, friends?
His magic stream
She gave birth to a lot of nonsense,
And how many jokes and poems,
And arguments, and funny dreams!
But it changes with a noisy foam
It's in my stomach,
And I am a prudent Bordeaux
I've already chosen him over him.
I am no longer capable of Ai;
Au is like a lover
Shiny, windy, lively,
Both wayward and empty
But you, Bordeaux, are like a friend.,
Who, for better or for worse,
Comrade, always, everywhere,
Ready to do us a favor
Or quiet to share leisure time.
Long live Bordeaux, our friend!
The fire went out; barely with ashes
The golden coal is tinged;
A barely noticeable stream
Steam is spinning, and warmth
The fireplace is barely breathing. Smoke from pipes
It goes down the pipe. Light Cup
Still hissing in the middle of the table.
Evening finds the mist
(I love friendly lies
And a friendly glass of wine
Sometimes the one that is named
It's time between the wolf and the dog,
And why, I don't see.)
Now friends are talking:
Well, what about the neighbors? What is Tatiana?
Is Olga frisky yours?
That's enough, honey, the whole family
She is well; they told me to bow.
Oh, darling, how prettier you are
Olga has shoulders, what a chest!
What a soul! Someday
Let's go to them; you will oblige them;
Otherwise, my friend, you judge for yourself:
I looked in twice, and there
You can't even show your nose at them.
That's what a fool I am!
You're invited to them next week.
Yes, Tatiana's name day
On Saturday. Olenka and mother
They told me to call, and there is no reason
You don't have to come to the call.
But there will be a lot of people there
And all that kind of rabble
And, no one, I'm sure!
Who will be there? my own family.
Let's go, do me a favor!
Well, what about it?
At these words, he drained
A glass, an offering to a neighbor,
Then he started talking again
About Olga: such is love!
He was cheerful. Two weeks later
A happy deadline was set.
And the secret of the marriage bed,
And a wreath of sweet love
His raptures were expected.
Hymena worries, sorrows,
Yawns are cold stuff
He had never dreamed of it.
Meanwhile, we, the enemies of Hymen,
In home life, we see one
A series of tedious paintings,
A novel in the taste of La Fontaine
My poor Lensky, he
Was born for this life with his heart.
He was loved at least
That's what he thought, and he was happy.
Blessed is he a hundred times who is devoted to the faith,
Who, having calmed down a cold mind,
He rests in the bliss of the heart,
Like a drunken traveler at night,
Or, more gently, like a moth,
Into a spring sunken flower;
But the one who foresees everything is pathetic,
Whose head is not spinning,
Who are all the movements, all the words
In their translation, he hates,
Whose heart has been cooled by experience
And he forbade forgetting!
That year, the autumn weather
I stood in the yard for a long time,
Nature was waiting for winter.
Snow fell only in January
On the third in the night. Waking up early,
Tatiana saw through the window
In the morning, the whitewashed courtyard,
Curtains, roofs and fence,
There are light patterns on the glasses,
Trees in winter silver,
Forty merry people in the yard
And softly carpeted mountains
Winters are a resplendent carpet.
Everything is bright, everything is white all around.
Winter!.. The peasant, triumphant,
Updates the path on the firewood;
His horse, feeling the snow,
Trotting along somehow;
The reins are fluffy blowing up,
A dashing caravan is flying;
The driver is sitting on a bench
In a sheepskin coat, in a red sash.
Here's a yard boy running around,
Putting a bug in the sled,
Transforming yourself into a horse;
The minx has already frozen his finger:
He is both hurt and amused,
And his mother threatens him through the window
But maybe this kind of
Paintings will not attract you:
All this is low nature;
There is not much elegant here.
Warmed by inspiration from God,
Another poet with a luxurious style
He painted the first snow for us
And all the shades of winter bliss;
He will captivate you, I am sure of that,
Drawing in fiery verses
Secret sleigh rides;
But I'm not going to fight
Not with him yet, not with you,
The Finnish singer is young!
Tatiana (Russian soul,
I don't know why)
With her cold beauty
I loved the Russian winter,
In the sun and on a frosty day,
And the sleigh, and the dawn is late
The radiance of pink snow,
And the haze of Epiphany evenings.
In the old days, they triumphed
In their house these evenings:
Maids from all over the yard
They were guessing about their young ladies
And they were promised every year
Husbands of the military and the campaign.
Tatiana believed in the legends
The common people of antiquity,
And dreams, and card fortune-telling,
And the predictions of the moon.
She was worried about the signs;
All objects are mysterious to her
Did they proclaim anything,
Premonitions pressed against my chest.
A simpering cat sitting on the stove,
Purring, he washed his snout with his paw:
That was an unmistakable sign to her,
That the guests are coming. Suddenly seeing
The younger two-horned face of the moon
In the sky on the left side,
She was trembling and turning pale.
When is a shooting star
I was flying through the dark sky
And it crumbled, then
In her confusion, Tanya was in a hurry,
While the star was still rolling,
The desire of the heart to whisper to her.
When it happened somewhere
She should meet a black monk
Or a fast hare between the fields
I ran across her path,
Not knowing what to start with fear,
Full of sorrowful forebodings,
She was waiting for misfortune.
Well? I found a secret charm
And she's really terrified.:
This is how nature created us,
She is prone to counter-speech.
It's Christmas Eve. That's the joy!
The windy youth is guessing,
Which is not sorry for anything,
Before which life is far away
Lies bright, boundless;
Old age is guessing through glasses
At his coffin board,
Having lost everything irrevocably;
And still: hope for them
He lies with his childish babble.
Tatiana with a curious look
He looks at the sunken wax:
It's a wonderfully molded pattern
Something wonderful says to her;
From a dish full of water,
The rings come out in succession;
And a ring came out for her
To the song of the old days:
The peasants are all rich there,
They are rowing silver with a shovel;
To whom I sing, that's good
And glory! But it promises losses
This song is a pitiful tune;
A sweet little cat to the heart of virgins.
The night is frosty, the whole sky is clear;
Heavenly luminaries wondrous choir
It flows so quietly, so according to
Tatiana on the wide courtyard
She goes out in an open dress,
For a month, the mirror is pointing;
But there is one in the dark mirror
The sad moon is trembling
Chu virgo
Flying towards him on tiptoe,
And her voice sounds
More gentle than a pipe tune:
What's your name? He's watching
And he answers: Agathon.
Tatiana, on the advice of the nanny
Gathering at night to conjure,
Quietly ordered in the bathhouse
Set the table for two sets;
But suddenly Tatiana became afraid
And I'm thinking about Svetlana
I was scared.
We can't do magic with Tatiana.
Tatiana silk belt
I took it off, undressed and went to bed
She lay down. Lel is hovering over her,
And under the down pillow
The maiden's mirror is lying.
Everything has calmed down. Tatiana is sleeping.
And Tatiana has a wonderful dream.
She dreams that she is
Walking through a snow glade,
Surrounded by a sad haze;
In the snowdrifts in front of her
It makes noise, swirls with its own wave
Ebullient, dark and gray-haired
A stream that is not constrained in winter;
Two perches, glued together by an ice floe,
A trembling, disastrous bridge,
Put through the stream;
And before the roaring abyss,
Full of Perplexity,
She stopped.
Like an annoying separation,
Tatiana grumbles at the stream;
Does not see anyone who has a hand
From that side, I would have given it to her;
But suddenly the snowdrift began to move.
And who came out from under it?
A big, disheveled bear;
Tatiana ah! And he roars,
And a paw with sharp claws
He handed it to her; she braced herself
She leaned on her trembling hand
And with timid steps
I crossed the stream;
Went and what? The bear is after her!
She, not daring to look back,
Hurriedly accelerates her step;
But from a shaggy footman
He can't escape in any way;
Grunting, the obnoxious bear falls down;
The forest is before them; the pines are motionless
In its frowning glory;
Their branches are all burdened
Patches of snow; through the peaks
Aspens, birches and lime trees naked
The ray of the luminaries of the night shines;
There is no road; bushes, rapids
Everyone is covered in a snowstorm,
Buried deep in the snow.
Tatiana goes into the forest; the bear follows her;
The snow is loose up to her knees;
That long bough of hers by the neck
It will catch you suddenly, then out of your ears
Gold earrings will be torn out by force;
That's in the fragile snow with a cute foot
A wet shoe will get stuck;
Then she will drop the handkerchief;
She has no time to lift; she is afraid,
He hears the bear behind him,
And even with a trembling hand
The edge of the clothes is ashamed to raise;
She runs, he follows her,
And she has no strength to run anymore.
She fell into the snow; the bear was nimble
She is grabbed and carried;
She is insensitively submissive,
He won't move, he won't die;
He rushes her along the forest road;
Suddenly, there is a squalid hut between the trees;
It's all in the wilderness; he's everywhere
It is covered with desert snow,
And the window is shining brightly,
And there is shouting and noise in the hut;
The bear said: My godfather is here:
Warm up at his place a little!
And he goes straight into the hall
And he puts it on the doorstep.
When she came to her senses, Tatiana looked:
There was no bear; she was in the hall;
There is a scream and the clink of a glass outside the door,
Like at a big funeral;
Not seeing a bit of sense here,
She looks quietly through the crack,
And what does he see?.. at the table
Monsters are sitting all around:
One with horns and a dog's face,
The other one with a rooster's head,
There's a witch with a goatee here,
Here the skeleton is prim and proud,
There is a carla with a ponytail, but here
Half-crane and half-cattle.
Even scarier, even weirder:
Here's a cancer riding a spider,
Here is a skull on a goose neck
Spinning in a red hood,
Here the mill is dancing side by side
And it cracks and flaps its wings;
Barking, laughing, singing, whistling and clapping,
Human rumor and horse top!
But what did Tatiana think,
When I found out among the guests
Someone who is sweet and scary to her,
The hero of our novel!
Onegin is sitting at the table
And he looks furtively at the door.
He will give a sign
He drinks
He'll laugh.
He will furrow his brows
He's the boss there, that's clear:
And Tanya is not so terrible,
And, curious, now
I opened the door a little
Suddenly the wind blew, extinguishing
The fire of night lamps;
The gang of brownies was confused;
Onegin, his eyes sparkling,
He gets up from the table, rattling;
Everyone stood up: he was going to the door.
And she is afraid; and hurriedly
Tatiana tries to run:
It is impossible in any way; impatiently
Rushing, he wants to scream:
Eugene pushed the door open:
And a maiden
Appeared to the eyes of the hellish ghosts;
Fierce laughter rang wildly; the eyes of all,
Hooves, trunks are crooked,
Crested tails, fangs,
Mustache, bloody tongues,
Horns and fingers are made of bone,
Everything points to her,
And everyone is shouting: mine! Mine!
Mine! Yevgeny said menacingly,
And the whole gang suddenly disappeared;
I stayed in the frosty darkness
The younger virgo is with him himself-a friend;
Onegin is quietly captivating
Tatiana is in a corner and composes
Her on a rickety bench
And he bows his head
To her shoulder; suddenly Olga enters,
Lensky was behind her; the light flashed;
Onegin waved his hand,
And he wanders wildly with his eyes,
And scolds uninvited guests;
Tatiana is barely alive.
The argument is louder, louder; suddenly Eugene
Grabs a long knife, and in a moment
Lensky is defeated; the shadows are terrible thickened;
There was an unbearable scream
And Tanya woke up in horror
He looks, it's already light in the room;
In the window through the frozen glass
The crimson ray of dawn is playing;
The door opened. Olga to her,
Aurors of the northern Alay
And lighter than a swallow, it flies in;
Well, he says, you tell me,
Who did you see in your dream?
But she, the sisters, did not notice,
Lying in bed with a book,
Leaf by leaf sorting through,
And he doesn't say anything.
Although this book was not
No sweet fictions of the poet,
No wise truths, no paintings,
But neither Virgil nor Racine,
Neither Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneca,
Not even a Ladies Fashion Magazine
No one was so interested:
It was, friends, Martin Zadeka,
The head of the Chaldean sages,
A fortune teller, an interpreter of dreams.
This is a profound creation
Brought by a wandering merchant
One day to them in solitude
And finally for Tatiana
Its with a disparate
He conceded in three and a half minutes,
In addition, taking more for them
Collecting area fables,
Grammar, two Petriads
Yes, Marmontel's third volume.
Martin Zadeka became later
Tanya's favorite, He's a joy
In all her sorrows , he gives her
And he sleeps with her constantly.
She is disturbed by a dream.
Not knowing how to understand it,
Dreams have a terrible meaning
Tatiana wants to find it.
Tatiana in the short table of contents
Finds it in alphabetical order
Words: forest, storm, witch, spruce,
Hedgehog, darkness, bridge, bear, snowstorm
And other things. Her doubts
Martin Zadeka will not decide;
But a sinister dream promises her
There are many sad adventures.
For a few days she then
I was worried about that.
But with a crimson hand
Dawn from the morning valleys
It takes you out with the sun behind it
A merry birthday party.
In the morning, the Larins' house is visited
The whole house is full; whole families
The neighbors gathered in carts,
In caravans, in chaises and in sleighs.
There is a crush in the hall, an alarm;
There is a meeting of new faces in the living room,
The barking of the mosek, the smacking of the girls,
Noise, laughter, crush at the doorstep,
Bows, shuffling of guests,
Wet nurses cry and cry of children.
With his portly wife
A fat Trifle has arrived;
Gvozdin, the host is excellent,
The owner of the poor men;
Cattle, a gray-haired couple,
With children of all ages, counting
From thirty to two years old;
The county frenchman Petushkov,
My cousin's brother, Buyanov,
In fluff, in a cap with a visor
(As you are, of course, familiar with it),
And a retired adviser to Flyanov,
A heavy gossip, an old rascal,
A glutton, a bribe taker and a buffoon.
With the family of Panfil Harlikov
Monsieur Triquet also arrived,
A wit, recently from Tambov,
Wearing glasses and a red wig.
Like a true Frenchman, in your pocket
Trike brought a verse to Tatiana
To a voice known by children:
Reeez ous, bee endorme.
Between the old songs of the almanac
This verse was printed;
Trike, the shrewd poet,
He was born out of the dust,
And boldly instead of bee Nna
I put bee Tatana on.
And now from a nearby village
Mature young ladies idol,
County mothers are a joy,
The company commander arrived;
Oh, the news, but what!
The music will be regimental!
The colonel sent it himself.
What a joy: there will be a ball!
Girls jump ahead of time;
But the food was served. The couple
They go to the table hand in hand.
The young ladies are crowding towards Tatiana;
Men are against; and, crossing themselves,
The crowd buzzes, sitting down at the table.
The conversations stopped for a moment;
The mouth is chewing. From all sides
Plates and cutlery rattle
Yes, glasses are ringing.
But soon the guests gradually
A general alarm will be raised.
No one is listening, they are shouting,
They laugh, argue and squeak.
Suddenly the doors are wide open. Lensky enters,
And Onegin is with him.
The hostess shouts:
Guests are crowding, everyone is taking away
Appliances, chairs as soon as possible;
They call two friends and put them in jail.
They put him right in front of Tanya,
And, the morning moon is paler
And more trembling than a hunted deer,
She's a darkening eye
Does not lift: bursts violently
There is a passionate heat in her; she is stuffy, sick;
She greets two friends
He does not hear, tears from his eyes
They want to drip; they're ready
The poor thing is going to faint;
But will and reason are the power
They prevailed. She has two words
She said quietly through her teeth
And sat at the table.
Tragi-nervous phenomena,
Girlish fainting, tears
Eugene could not stand it for a long time:
He had suffered enough of them.
A weirdo, having got to a huge feast,
He was already angry. But the maid is languid
Noticing the trembling impulse,
Looking down in annoyance,
He sulked and, indignant,
He swore to infuriate Lensky
And certainly a lot of revenge.
Now, in advance, triumphant,
He began to draw in his soul
Caricatures of all the guests.
Of course, not only Eugene
I could see Tanya's confusion;
But the purpose of looks and judgments
At that time, the pie was fat
(Unfortunately, too salty);
Yes, in a salted bottle,
Between roast and blanc manger,
Tsimlyanskoe is already being carried;
Behind him is a line of narrow, long glasses,
Like your waist,
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
The subject of my innocent poems,
Love is a tempting violet,
You're the one I've been drunk on!
Getting rid of the wet cork,
The bottle popped; the wine
Hisses; and so with an important posture,
Tortured by the verse for a long time,
Trike stands up; the assembly is in front of him
He keeps a deep silence.
Tatiana is almost alive; Trike,
Turning to her with a piece of paper in his hand,
He sang out of tune. Splashes, clicks
He is welcomed. She
The singer is forced to sit down;
The poet is modest, though great,
Her health is the first to drink
And he passes the verse to her.
Send greetings, congratulations;
Tatiana thanks everyone.
When it comes to Eugenia
Got it, then the maidens look languid,
Her embarrassment, her tiredness
Pity was born in his soul:
He bowed to her in silence,
But somehow the gaze of his eyes
He was wonderfully gentle. Is that why,
That he was really touched,
Or was he flirting, playing pranks,
Involuntarily, or out of good will,
But this gaze expressed tenderness:
He revived Tanya's heart.
Chairs rattle as they are pushed back;
The crowd is pouring into the living room:
So bees from a delicious hive
A noisy swarm is flying to the field.
Happy with the festive lunch,
The neighbor sniffs in front of the neighbor;
The ladies sat down by the fireplace;
The girls are whispering in the corner;
The green tables are open:
The name of the fervent players
Boston and the Old Men's Pawnshop,
And whist, hitherto famous,
A monotonous family,
All sons of greedy boredom.
Eight Roberts have already played
Heroes of Whist; eight times
They were changing places;
And they're bringing tea. I love the hour
With lunch, tea
And dinner. We know the time
In a village without big vanities:
The stomach
And by the way, I'll note in parentheses,
What am I talking about in my stanzas
I talk about feasts just as often,
About different dishes and traffic jams,
How are you, divine Omir,
You, the idol of thirty centuries!
But tea is being brought; the girls are decorous
They barely took up the saucers,
Suddenly, from behind the door in the long hall
The bassoon and flute rang out.
Delighted by the thunder of music,
Leaving a cup of tea with rum,
Paris county towns,
He approaches Olga Petushkov,
To Tatiana Lensky; Harlikov,
The bride of the ripe years,
My poet takes Tambov,
Buyanov drove away to Pustyakova,
And everyone poured out into the hall.
And the ball shines in all its glory.
At the beginning of my novel
(See the first notebook)
I wanted to like Alban
Describe the St. Petersburg Ball;
But, amused by an empty dream,
I started remembering
About the legs of ladies I know.
In your narrow footsteps,
Oh legs, it's full of mistakes!
With the betrayal of my youth
It's time for me to become smarter,
To get better in business and in style,
And this fifth notebook
To clean from deviations.
Monotonous and insane,
Like the whirlwind of a young life,
The waltz is spinning, a noisy whirlwind;
The couple flashes by the couple.
Approaching the moment of vengeance,
Onegin, secretly grinning,
He approaches Olga. Quickly with her
Hanging around the guests,
Then he puts her on a chair,
He starts talking about this and that;
Two minutes later, then
He continues the waltz with her again;
Everyone is amazed. Lensky himself
He doesn't believe his own eyes.
The Mazurka was heard. It happened,
When the Mazurka thunder thundered,
Everything was shaking in the huge hall,
The parquet cracked under his heel,
The frames were shaking and rattling;
Now it's not that: and we, as ladies,
We slide along the lacquer boards.
But in the cities, in the villages
I also saved the Mazurka
The initial beauties:
Jumps, heels, mustache
All the same: I haven't changed them
Dashing fashion, our tyrant,
The disease of the newest Russians.
Buyanov, my perky brother,
He brought us to our hero
Tatiana and Olga; quickly
Onegin went with Olga;
He leads her, gliding casually,
And, bending down, he whispers softly to her
Some kind of vulgar madrigal,
And he shakes his hand and burns
In her proud face
The blush is brighter. Lensky is mine
I saw everything: I flared up, I'm not myself;
In jealous indignation
The poet is waiting for the end of the Mazurka
And he's calling her to the cotillion.
But she can't. Can't you? But what?
Yes, Olga has already given her word
Onegin. Oh, my God, my God!
What does he hear? She could
Is it possible? Just a little out of diapers,
A flirt, a flighty child!
She knows the trick,
She's already learned how to change!
Lensky is unable to bear the blow;
Women's leprosy swearing,
It turns out that he demands a horse
And he jumps. A couple of pistols,
Two bullets
Suddenly his fate will be resolved.
Noticing that Vladimir had disappeared,
Onegin, we are being driven by boredom again,
Near Olga, he plunged into the duma,
Pleased with his revenge.
Olenka yawned behind him,
I was looking for Lensky with my eyes,
And the endless cotillion
It tormented her like a heavy dream.
But it's over. They're coming for dinner.
Beds are made; for guests
The overnight stay is taken away from the entrance hall
Right up to the girlish. Everyone needs it
A peaceful dream. Onegin is mine
One went home to sleep.
Everything calmed down: in the living room
Snoring is a heavy trifle
With his heavy half.
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov
And Flyanov, not quite healthy,
They lay down on chairs in the dining room,
And on the floor is Monsieur Triquet,
In a sweatshirt, in an old hat.
The girls in Tatiana's rooms
And Olga is all wrapped up in sleep.
Alone, sad under the window
Illuminated by Diana's ray,
Poor Tatiana is not sleeping
And he looks into the dark field.
His unexpected appearance,
The instant tenderness of the eyes
And strange behavior with Olga
To the depths of his soul
She's penetrated; she can't
I can't understand him; it bothers me
Her jealous longing,
It's like a cold hand
Her heart feels tight, like an abyss
It's black and noisy under it
But death from him is kind.
I don't grumble: why grumble?
He can't give me happiness.
Go ahead, go ahead, my story!
A new face is calling us.
Five versts from Krasnogorie,
The village of Lensky, lives
And long live to this day
In the philosophical desert
Zaretsky, once a brawler,
The chieftain of the card gang,
The head of the rakes, the tribune of the tavern,
Now it's kind and simple
The father of the family is single,
A reliable friend, a peaceful landowner
And even an honest man:
This is how our century is being corrected!
Sometimes, the flattering voice of light
He showed off his evil bravery:
He really hit the ace with a pistol
I got into five fathoms,
And I can say that I got into a battle
Once in a real rapture
He distinguished himself, bravely in the mud
Falling off the Kalmyk horse,
Like a drunk, and the French
I was captured: a dredge pledge!
The newest Regulus, the god of honor,
Ready to relive the bond,
To have Faith every morning
There are three bottles on loan to drain.
He used to sound funny.,
He knew how to fool a fool
And it's nice to fool a smart one,
Either explicitly, or surreptitiously,
Although he has other things
We did not pass without science,
Although sometimes I'm in a mess myself
He was caught like a simpleton.
He could argue cheerfully,
To answer sharply and stupidly,
Sometimes it is prudent to keep silent,
Sometimes it 's prudent to quarrel,
Friends to quarrel with the young
And put them on the barrier,
Or to make them reconcile
In order to have breakfast with the three of them,
And then secretly dishonor
A funny joke, a lie.
Sed aa tempora! Audacity
(Like a love dream, another prank)
Passes with youth alive.
As I said, my Zaretsky,
Under the canopy of cherry trees and acacias
Hiding from the storms at last,
He lives like a true sage,
He plants cabbage like Horace,
Breeds ducks and geese
And teaches the alphabet to children.
He was not stupid; and my Eugene,
Not respecting the heart in him,
I also loved the spirit of his judgments,
And common sense about this and that.
He used to enjoy it.,
I've seen him, and I haven't seen him at all
I wasn't surprised in the morning,
When he saw it.
The one after the first greeting,
Interrupting the conversation that started,
Onegin, grinning,
He handed me a note from the poet.
Onegin went to the window
And I read it to myself.
It was a pleasant, noble one,
A short call, or a cartel:
Courteously, with cold clarity
Lensky called his friend to a duel.
Onegin from the first movement,
To the ambassador of such an assignment
Turning around, without unnecessary words
He said he was always ready.
Zaretsky stood up without explanation;
I didn't want to stay in the share,
Having many things to do at home,
He immediately went out; but Eugene
Alone with your soul
I was dissatisfied with myself.
And it serves you right: in a strict analysis,
Calling himself to a secret court,
He blamed himself for a lot of things:
First of all, he was already wrong,
What is above a timid, gentle love
That's how Vechor casually joked.
And secondly: let the poet
Fooling around; at the age of eighteen
It's excusable. Evgeniy,
Loving the young man with all my heart,
I had to prove myself
Not a ball of speculation,
Not an ardent boy, a fighter,
But a husband with honor and intelligence.
He could have discovered the feelings,
Instead of bristling like an animal;
He was supposed to disarm
A young heart. But now
It's too late; time has flown away
Besides, this is the case
The old duelist intervened;
He's angry, he's a gossip, he's a talker
Of course, there must be contempt
At the cost of his funny words,
But the whispers, the laughter of fools
And here is the public opinion!
The spring of honor, our idol!
And that's what the world is spinning on!
Seething with impatient hostility,
The poet is waiting for an answer at home;
And now the neighbor is grandiose
I brought the answer solemnly.
Now it's a holiday for the jealous one!
He was always afraid that the prankster
Didn't laugh it off somehow,
Having invented a trick and a breast
Turning away from the gun.
Now the doubts are solved:
They have to go to the mill
Arrive tomorrow before dawn,
Pull the trigger on each other
And aim at the thigh or the temple.
Deciding to hate a flirt,
Boiling Lensky did not want to
To see Olga before the fight,
I looked at the sun, at the clock,
He waved his hand one last time
And I ended up with the neighbors.
He thought to embarrass Olenka,
To impress with your arrival;
It was not there: as before,
To meet the poor singer
Olenka jumped off the porch,
It is like a windy hope,
Frisky, carefree, cheerful,
Well, exactly the same as it was.
That was Olenka's first question.
All the feelings in Lensky were confused,
And he hung his nose in silence.
Jealousy and annoyance disappeared
Before this clarity of view,
Before this gentle simplicity,
Before this frisky soul!..
He looks at me with sweet emotion;
He sees that he is still loved;
He is already tormented by remorse,
Ready to ask her forgiveness,
Trembling, unable to find words,
He's happy, he's almost healthy.
And again thoughtful, sad
Before my dear Olga,
Vladimir has no power
Yesterday to remind her;
He thinks: I will be her savior.
I will not tolerate a corrupter
With fire and sighs and praises
Tempted the younger heart;
So that the worm is despicable, poisonous
Sharpened the lily stalk;
To have a two-morning flower
Withered still half-open.
It all meant, friends:
I'm shooting with a friend.
If only he knew what kind of wound it was
My Tatiana's heart was burning!
When would Tatiana have known,
When would she have known,
What's tomorrow Lensky and Evgeny
They will argue about the grave canopy;
Ah, maybe her love
I would connect my friends again!
But this passion is also accidental
No one has opened it yet.
Onegin was silent about everything;
Tatiana languished secretly;
Only a nanny would know,
Yes, she was stupid.
Lensky was distracted all evening,
Now silent, now cheerful again;
But the one who is cherished by the muse,
Always like this: frowning brow,
He sat down at the harpsichord
And he played only chords on them,
That is, with eyes fixed on Olga,
Whispered: Isn't it true? I'm happy.
But it's too late; it's time to go. It shrank
He has a heart full of longing;
Saying goodbye to the young virgin,
It felt like it was bursting.
She looks at his face.
And onto the porch.
Having arrived home, pistols
He examined it, then put it in
Put them back in the drawer and undressed,
By candlelight, Schiller opened;
But one thought surrounds him;
A sad heart does not sleep in him:
With an inexplicable beauty
He sees Olga in front of him.
Vladimir closes the book,
He takes a pen; his poems,
Full of love nonsense,
They sound and flow. He reads them
He's out loud, in lyrical heat,
Like Delvig drunk at a feast.
Poems have been preserved in case;
I have them; here they are:
Where, where have you gone,
Are my golden days of spring?
What does the coming day have in store for me?
My gaze catches him in vain,
He lurks in the deep darkness.
There is no need; the law of fate is right.
Will I fall, pierced by an arrow,
Or it will fly by,
All good things: vigils and sleep
The hour is coming.;
Blessed is the day of worries,
Blessed is the coming of darkness!
The day's ray will flash in the morning
And a bright day will begin to play;
And I, perhaps, am the tomb
I'll go down into the mysterious canopy,
And the memory of the young poet
The slow Summer will swallow you up,
The world will forget me; but you
Will you come, virgin of beauty,
To shed a tear over an early urn
And to think: he loved me,
He dedicated one to me
The sad dawn of a stormy life!..
A warm friend, a welcome friend,
Come, come: I am your husband!..
So he wrote darkly and listlessly
(What do we call romanticism,
At least there is no romanticism here
I don't see; but what's in it for us?)
And finally before dawn,
Bowing his tired head,
On the buzzword ideal
Lensky dozed off quietly;
But only with a sleepy charm
He forgot himself, the neighbor
An office enters the silent one
And he wakes up Lensky with an appeal:
It's time to get up: it's past seven.
Onegin is surely waiting for us.
But he was wrong: Eugene
I was sleeping like a dead man at that time.
The night shadows are already thinning
And met by Vesper the rooster;
Onegin sleeps deeply for himself.
The sun is already rolling high,
And a migratory snowstorm
It glitters and curls; but the bed
Eugene hasn't left yet,
There is also a dream flying over him.
He finally woke up
And the curtain parted the floors;
He looks and sees that it's time
It's been a long time since we left the yard.
He's calling as soon as possible. Runs in
A French servant,
Guillot, offers him a robe and shoes
And she hands him the laundry.
Onegin is in a hurry to get dressed,
He tells the servant to get ready
Go with him and with yourself
Take also the combat box.
The cross-country sled is ready.
He sat down, he's flying to the mill.
They rushed over. He tells the servant to
Lepage's trunks are fatal
Carry him, and the horses
Drive off into the field to the two oaks.
Leaning on the dam, Lensky
I've been waiting impatiently for a long time;
Meanwhile, the mechanic is rustic,
Zaretsky condemned the millstone.
Onegin comes with an apology.
He said with amazement
Zaretsky,
In duels, the classic and the pedant,
He loved the method out of feeling,
And stretch the man
He didn't allow it somehow,
But in the strict rules of art,
According to all the traditions of antiquity
(What should we praise in it).
Here it is: my friend, monseur Guot.
I don't anticipate any objections.
To my performance:
Although he is an unknown person,
But he's certainly an honest guy.
Zaretsky bit his lip.
Onegin asked Lensky:
Vladimir said. And let's go
For the mill. While away
Our Zaretsky is an honest fellow
We have entered into an important agreement,
The enemies stand with downcast eyes.
Enemies! How long have we been apart
Did their bloodlust take them away?
Have they been leisure hours for a long time,
A meal, thoughts and deeds
Shared it amicably? Now it is malicious,
Hereditary enemies are like,
Like in a terrible, incomprehensible dream,
They are each other in silence
They prepare death in cold blood
Don't laugh at them until
Their hand was not stained,
Should we break up amicably?..
But a wildly secular feud
Afraid of false shame.
The pistols have already flashed,
The hammer rattles on the ramrod.
Bullets go into the faceted barrel,
And the trigger clicked for the first time.
Here's the gunpowder in a grayish trickle
It's spilling onto the shelf. Toothed,
Securely screwed flint
It's still cocked. For the near stump
Guillot becomes confused.
Cloaks are thrown by two enemies.
Zaretsky thirty-two steps
I measured it with excellent accuracy,
I spread my friends on the extreme trail,
And everyone took their own gun.
In cold blood,
Not yet aiming, two enemies
With a firm, quiet, even gait
Four steps crossed,
The four mortal stages.
Your gun then Eugene,
Without ceasing to advance,
He began to raise the first one quietly.
Here are five more steps,
And Lensky, squinting his left eye,
He also began to aim , but just
Onegin fired a shot
The clock is fixed: the poet
He drops the gun in silence,
He puts his hand gently on his chest
And falls. Misty eyes
It depicts death, not agony.
So slowly down the slope of the mountains,
Sparkling in the sun,
A block of snow is falling.
Instantly doused with cold,
Onegin is in a hurry to see the young man,
He looks, he calls him in vain:
He is no longer there. The younger singer
I found an untimely end!
The storm blew, the color is beautiful
Withered at the dawn,
The fire on the altar has gone out!..
He lay motionless, and strange
There was a languid world of his brow.
He was shot through the chest;
Blood flowed steaming from the wound.
One moment ago
Inspiration was beating in this heart,
Enmity, hope and love,
Life was playing, blood was boiling,
Now it's like an empty house,
Everything in it is both quiet and dark;
It has been silenced forever.
Shutters are closed, windows are chalked
Whitewashed. There is no hostess.
And where, God knows. The trace was gone.
A pleasantly cheeky epigram
Infuriate a misguided enemy;
It's nice to see how stubborn he is
Bowing their cheerful horns,
Involuntarily he looks in the mirror
And he's ashamed to recognize himself;
It's nicer if he's friends,
Howling foolishly: it's me!
It is even more pleasant to be silent
He needs to prepare an honest coffin
And quietly aim at the pale forehead
At a noble distance;
But to send him to his fathers
It will hardly be pleasant for you.
Well, if your gun
Smitten by a young friend,
An immodest look, or an answer,
Or some other trifle
The one who insulted you behind the bottle,
Or even himself in a passionate annoyance
Who proudly challenged you to battle,
Tell me: with your soul
What feeling will take over,
When we are motionless, on the ground
Before you with death on your forehead,
He's gradually stiffening up,
When he is deaf and silent
To your desperate appeal?
In the anguish of heartfelt remorse,
Clutching the gun with his hand,
Eugene looks at Lensky.
The neighbor decided.
Killed!.. With this terrible exclamation
Smitten, Onegin shudders
He goes away and calls people.
Zaretsky carefully puts
There's an icy corpse on the sleigh;
He's bringing a terrible treasure home.
Sensing the dead, they snore
And the horses are fighting, white foam
Steel wet bits,
And they flew like an arrow.
My friends, you feel sorry for the poet:
In the color of joyful hopes,
They have not yet been accomplished for the light,
A little bit of baby clothes,
Withered! Where is the hot excitement,
Where is the noble aspiration
And the feelings and thoughts of the young,
Tall, gentle, daring?
Where are the stormy desires of love,
And the thirst for knowledge and work,
And the fear of vice and shame,
And you, cherished dreams,
You, the ghost of an unearthly life,
You holy poetry dreams!
Maybe he's for the good of the world.
Or at least he was born for fame;
His silent lyre
A rattling, continuous ringing
She could have raised it for centuries. The poet,
Perhaps on the steps of light
A high step was waiting.
His suffering shadow,
Perhaps she took it with her
A holy mystery, and for us
The life-giving voice has died,
And beyond the grave
The anthem of the times does not come to her,
The blessing of the tribes.
Or maybe even that: the poet
The ordinary one was waiting for fate.
The youth of the summer would have passed:
In him, the ardor of the soul would have cooled.
In many ways, he would have changed,
Parted with the muses, got married,
In the village, happy and horny,
I would wear a quilted robe;
Would you really know life,
Had gout at the age of forty,
Drank, ate, was bored, got fat, got sick,
And finally in my bed
B died in the midst of children,
Whiny women and doctors.
But whatever it is, the reader,
Alas, the lover is young,
A poet, a thoughtful dreamer,
Killed by a friendly hand!
There is a place: to the left of the village,
Where did the inspiration pet live,
Two pine trees have grown together by their roots;
Trickles writhed beneath them
Streams of the neighboring valley.
The ploughman likes to rest there,
And plunge the reapers into the waves
Ringing pitchers are coming;
There's a thick one by the stream in the shade
A simple monument has been erected.
Under it (as it starts to drip
Spring rain on the grain fields)
The shepherd, weaving his mottled lapot,
He sings about the Volga fishermen;
And the townswoman is young,
Spending the summer in the village,
When she's riding headlong she
Rushing through the fields alone,
He stops the horse in front of him, pulling
On the leash,
And, Fleur turned away from the hat,
He reads with his eyes
A simple inscription and a tear
It clouds the delicate eyes.
And he walks in an open field,
Plunging into dreams, she;
The soul is in it for a long time involuntarily
The fate of Lensky is full;
And he thinks: Has something happened to Olga?
Did her heart suffer for a long time,
Or is it time for tears soon?
And where is her sister now?
And where is the fugitive of people and light,
Fashionable beauties are a fashionable enemy,
Where is this cloudy weirdo,
The murderer of the young poet?
I will eventually report to you
I will give you details about everything,
But not now. Even though I'm cordially
I love my hero,
At least I'll go back to him, of course,
But I have no time for him now.
Summers tend to be harsh prose,
Let's chase the naughty rhyme,
And I'm following her lazily.
There is no ancient hunting in Peru
Dirty the flying sheets;
Other, cold dreams,
Other, strict concerns
And in the noise of the light and in the silence
They disturb the sleep of my soul.
I have known the voice of other desires,
I have known a new sadness;
I have no hopes for the former,
But I am sorry for the old sadness.
Dreams, dreams! Where is your sweetness?
Where is the eternal rhyme to her youth?
Is it really finally
Has her crown withered, withered?
Is it really straight and true
Without elegiac ideas
The spring of my days rushed by
(What have I been jokingly saying up to now)?
And is there really no return for her?
Am I going to be thirty soon?
So, my noon has come, and I need to
I have to admit it, I see.
But so be it: let's say goodbye amicably,
Oh, my easy youth!
Thank you for the pleasure,
For the sadness, for the sweet torment,
For the noise, for the storms, for the feasts,
For everything, for all your gifts;
Thank you. By you,
Amid worries and in silence,
I enjoyed it
That's enough! With a clear soul
I am now embarking on a new path
Take a break from the past life.
Let me look around. Excuse me, seni,
Where my days flowed in the wilderness,
Filled with passion and laziness
And the dreams of a thoughtful soul.
And you, the younger inspiration,
Excite my imagination,
Revive the slumber of the heart,
Come to my corner more often,
Don't let the poet's soul cool down,
To harden, to harden,
And finally petrify
In the deadening rapture of light,
In this pool, where am I with you
I'm swimming, dear friends!
Driven by the external rays,
There is already snow from the surrounding mountains
They escaped in muddy streams
To the sunken meadows.
Nature with a clear smile
Meets the morning of the year through a dream;
The skies are shining blue.
Still transparent, forests
It's like they're turning green.
The bee behind the tribute field
It flies from the wax cell.
The valleys dry up and are full of color;
The herds are noisy, and the nightingale
He sang in the silence of the nights.
How sad is your appearance to me,
Spring, spring! It's time for love!
What a languid excitement
In my soul, in my blood!
With what heavy emotion
I'm enjoying the breeze
In the face of the blowing spring
In the bosom of rural silence!
Or is pleasure alien to me,
And everything that pleases, lives,
Everything that rejoices and glitters
Boredom and longing
On a dead soul for a long time
And everything seems dark to her?
Or, not happy about the return
The sheets that died in the fall,
We remember the bitter loss,
Listening to the new noise of the forests;
Or with a lively nature
We bring the confused duma closer
We are the fading of our years,
Who has no rebirth?
Perhaps it occurs to us
In the midst of a poetic dream
A different, old spring
And the heart makes us tremble
The dream of the other side,
About a wonderful night, about the moon
Here's the time: good sloths,
Epicureans are wise men,
You, the indifferent lucky ones,
You, Levshin's school chicks,
You village Priams,
And you sensitive ladies,
Spring is calling you to the village,
It's time for warmth, flowers, and work,
It's time for the festivities of inspired
And seductive nights.
Into the fields, friends! Hurry up, hurry up,
In carriages heavily loaded,
For long or by post,
Stretch out from the outposts of the city.
And you, the benevolent reader,
In his wheelchair, discharged
Leave the restless hail,
Where did you have fun in winter;
With my wayward muse
Let's go listen to the oakwood noise
Above the nameless river
In the village where Eugene is mine,
The hermit is idle and sad,
Until recently, I lived in winter
Tanya is young in the neighborhood,
My sweet dreamer,
But where is he now?
Where sad he left a mark.
Between the mountains lying in a semicircle,
Let's go to where the stream is,
Twisting, he runs through a green meadow
To the river through the lime forest.
There's a nightingale, a lover of spring,
He sings all night; the rosehip blooms,
And the key dialect is heard,
The coffin stone is visible there
In the shade of two outdated pines.
The inscription says to the alien:
Vladimir Lensky lies here,
Who died early by the death of the brave,
In such a year, such a year.
Rest in peace, young poet!
On the branches of a bowed pine tree,
There used to be an early breeze
Above this humble urn
He was rocking a mysterious wreath.
Sometimes, in late leisure
Two friends came here,
And on the grave in the moonlight,
Hugging each other, they cried.
But now the monument is sad
Forgotten. There is a familiar trail to it
It stalled. There is no wreath on the branch;
One, underneath, is gray-haired and frail
The shepherd is still singing
And he weaves poor shoes.
My poor Lensky! languishing,
She didn't cry for long.
Alas! the bride is young
She is unfaithful to her sadness.
The other attracted her attention,
The other managed her suffering
To put to sleep with love flattery,
Ulan knew how to captivate her,
Ulan is loved by her soul
And now with him before the altar
She is shamefacedly under the crown
He stands with his head bowed,
With fire in downcast eyes,
With a light smile on his lips.
My poor Lensky! Beyond the grave
Within the limits of eternity deaf
Was he embarrassed, the singer is sad,
Treason by the fatal news,
Or over the Summer euthanized
The poet, blessed with insensibility,
He's not embarrassed by anything,
And the world is closed to him and mute?..
So! indifferent oblivion
Waiting for us behind the coffin.
Enemies, friends, mistresses voice
Suddenly it stops. About one name
The Heirs are an angry chorus
Starts an obscene argument.
And soon Olya's ringing voice
The Larin family fell silent.
Ulan, his slave share,
He had to go with her to the regiment.
Weeping bitterly,
An old woman saying goodbye to her daughter,
It seemed that she was almost alive,
But Tanya couldn't cry;
It was only covered with a mortal pallor
Her sad face.
When everyone came out on the porch,
And everything, saying goodbye, was bustling
Around the carriage of the young,
Tatiana saw them off.
And for a long time, as if through a fog,
She watched them go
And here is one, one Tatiana!
Alas! a friend of so many years,
Her dove is young,
Her confidante is dear,
Fate has brought her into the distance,
I am forever separated from her.
Like a shadow, she wanders aimlessly,
He looks at the empty garden
There is no joy for her anywhere, in anything,
And he finds no relief
She suppressed tears,
And my heart breaks in half.
And in the cruel solitude
Her passion burns stronger,
And about Onegin the distant
Her heart speaks louder.
She won't see him.;
She must hate him.
The murderer of his brother;
The poet died, but his
No one remembers, much less
His fiancee gave herself up.
The poet's memory flashed by
Like smoke across the blue sky,
There are two hearts about him, maybe,
Still sad, why be sad?..
It was evening. The sky was fading. Water
They flowed quietly. The beetle was buzzing.
The dances were already breaking up;
It was already burning, smoking, across the river
Fishing fire. In a clean field,
The moon in the silver light,
Immersed in her dreams,
Tatiana walked alone for a long time.
Walking, walking. And suddenly in front of him
From the hill, the lord sees a house,
A village, a grove under the hill
And a garden over a bright river.
She looks and the heart is in her
It began to beat more often and more strongly.
Her doubts are confusing:
Will I go forward, will I go back?..
He's not here. They don't know me
I'll take a look at the house, at this garden.
And so Tatiana comes down the hill,
Barely breathing; she circles around
Full of perplexity
And he enters the deserted courtyard.
Dogs rushed towards her, barking.
At the cry of her frightened
Children, the yard family
She came running noisily. Not without a fight
The boys dispersed the dogs,
Taking the young lady under his protection.
Tanya asked. Hurry up
The children ran to Anisya
Take the keys from her hall;
Anisya came to her at once,
And the door opened in front of them,
And Tanya enters the house empty,
Where our hero lived recently.
She looks: forgotten in the hall
The cue was resting on the billiard table,
He was lying on a crumpled sofa
A riding crop. Tanya dahle;
The old lady to her:
Here the gentleman sat alone.
I had lunch with him here in the winter
The late Lensky, our neighbor.
Come here, follow me.
This is the master's office;
He slept here, ate coffee,
I listened to the clerk's reports
And I read a book in the morning
And the old gentleman lived here;
With me, it used to be on Sunday,
Here under the window, wearing glasses,
He was playing the fool.
God grant his soul salvation,
And his bones are at peace
In the grave, in the damp mother earth!
Tatiana with a tender look
He looks at everything around him,
And everything seems priceless to her,
Everything gives life to a languid soul
A semi- painful joy:
And a table with a dimmed lamp,
And a pile of books, and under the window
The bed is covered with carpet,
And the view out the window through the moonlight twilight,
And this pale half-light,
And Lord Byron's portrait,
And a column with a cast-iron doll
Under a hat with a cloudy brow,
With hands clasped in a cross.
Tatiana has been in the fashionable cell for a long time
How charmed she is.
But it's too late. The wind got cold.
It's dark in the valley. The grove is sleeping
Above the misty river;
The moon has disappeared behind the mountain,
And a young pilgrim
It's time, it's time to go home.
And Tanya, hiding her excitement,
Not without sighing,
He starts on his way back.
But first he asks for permission
To visit a deserted castle,
To read books here alone.
Tatiana said goodbye to the housekeeper
Outside the gate. Every other day
She came back early in the morning
She's in the abandoned canopy.
And in a silent office,
Forgetting everything for a while,
I'm finally alone,
And she cried for a long time.
Then I started reading books.
At first she had no time for them,
But their choice seemed to be
It's strange to her. I have devoted myself to honor
Tatiana is a greedy soul;
And another world opened up to her.
Although we know that Eugene
I've stopped loving reading for a long time,
However, there are several creations
He excluded from the disgrace:
Singer Giaur and Juan
Yes, there are two or three more novels with him,
Which reflected the century
And the modern man
It is depicted quite correctly
With his immoral soul,
Selfish and dry,
Devoted to Dreams immensely,
With his embittered mind,
Boiling in empty action.
We kept many pages
A sharp nail mark;
The eyes of an attentive girl
They are focused on them more vividly.
Tatiana sees with trepidation,
What a thought, a remark
Onegin was amazed,
Which he silently agreed to.
In their fields she meets
The features of his pencil.
Onegin's soul is everywhere
He involuntarily expresses himself
Sometimes with a short word, then with a cross,
Then with a question hook.
And it starts a little bit
My Tatiana understand
It's clearer now
The one she sighs for
Condemned by a domineering fate:
A sad and dangerous eccentric,
The creation of hell or heaven,
This angel, this arrogant demon,
What about him? Is it imitation,
An insignificant ghost, or else
A Muscovite in a Harold's Raincoat,
Interpretation of other people's quirks,
Is there a full vocabulary of fashionable words?..
Is it not a parody?
Has she solved the riddle?
Has the word been found?
The clock is running; she forgot,
That they've been waiting for her at home for a long time,
Where are the two neighbors gathered
And where the conversation is about her.
The old woman said with a grunt.
After all, Olenka is younger than her.
It's time to get a girl, she-she, It's time; but what should I do with her? It's the same thing for everyone
I'm not coming. And she's still sad,
Yes, she wanders through the woods alone.
Into whom?
Buyanov wooed: refusal.
Ivan Petushkov too.
The Hussar Pykhtin was staying with us;
How he was attracted to Tanya,
How he crumbled like a small demon!
I thought: maybe it will go;
Where to! and again, the matter is apart.
Well, Mother? What happened?
To Moscow, to the bride fair!
I hear there are a lot of idle places.
Enough for one winter,
I'll at least give you a loan.
The old lady loved it very much
The advice is reasonable and good;
It oozed and immediately put it down
To go to Moscow in winter.
And Tanya hears this news.
To the court of the discerning light
Present clear features
Provincial simplicity,
And belated outfits,
And a belated warehouse of speeches;
Moscow dandies and circuses
Attract mocking glances!..
Oh fear! No, it's better and truer
She should stay in the wilderness of the forests.
Getting up at first light,
Now she's in a hurry to go to the fields
And, with tender eyes
Looking at them, he says:
Sorry, peaceful valleys,
And you, familiar mountain peaks,
And you, familiar forests;
I'm sorry, heavenly beauty,
Sorry, cheerful nature;
Changing the sweet, quiet light
To the noise of brilliant vanities
Forgive me, too, my freedom!
Where, why am I striving?
What does my fate promise me?
Her walks last a fraction of the time.
Now it's a hillock, then a stream
They stop involuntarily
Tatiana by her charm.
She's like with old friends.,
With its groves, meadows
Still in a hurry to talk.
But summer flies fast.
The golden autumn has come.
Nature is tremulous, pale,
Like a victim, magnificently decorated
Here's the north, catching up with the clouds,
He breathed, howled, and here she is
The sorceress winter is coming.
It came, scattered; in clumps
Hung on the branches of the oaks;
Lay down in wavy carpets
Among the fields, around the hills;
Brega with a motionless river
She leveled it with a plump veil;
Frost flashed. And we are glad
Mother Winter's pranks.
Only Tanya's heart is not happy with her.
She will not go to meet the winter,
To breathe in the frosty dust
And the first snow from the roof of the bathhouse
Wash your face, shoulders and chest:
Tatiana is afraid of the winter way.
The departure day is long overdue,
The deadline is also passing.
Inspected, re-upholstered, reinforced
An abandoned cart is forgotten.
The wagon train is ordinary, three caravans
They are carrying household belongings,
Pots, chairs, chests,
Jam in jars, mattresses,
Feather beds, cages with roosters,
Pots, basins et cetera,
Well, a lot of good stuff.
And here in the hut between the servants
There was a commotion, a farewell cry:
Eight nags were being led into the yard,
They are harnessed to the boyar wagon,
Chefs prepare breakfast,
The wagons are loaded with a mountain,
Women and coachmen are cursing.
On a skinny and shaggy nag
A bearded postilion is sitting,
The servants have come running to the gate
Saying goodbye to bars. And so
They sat down, and the venerable cart,
Sliding, crawls out the gate.
Sorry, peaceful places!
Sorry, the shelter is secluded!
Will I see you?.. And the stream came down
Tanya's eyes are streaming.
When the good enlightenment
Let's push back more boundaries,
Modern (by calculation
Philosophical tables,
Five hundred years later) roads, right,
We will change immensely:
Highway Russia here and here,
Having connected, they will cross.
Cast-iron bridges across the water
Step in a wide arc,
Push the mountains apart, under water
Proroem impudent vaults,
And he will lead a baptized world
There is a tavern at each station.
Now our roads are bad,
Forgotten bridges are rotting,
There are bedbugs and fleas at the stations
They don't give you a minute to fall asleep;
There are no inns. In a cold hut
Pompous, but hungry
For the sake of appearance, the price list is hanging
And futile teases the appetite,
Meanwhile, rural cyclopes
Before the slow fire
The Russian is treated with a hammer
From the lung of Europe,
Blessing the ruts
And the moats of the paternal land.
But winters are sometimes cold
The ride is pleasant and easy.
Like a verse without a thought in a fashionable song,
The winter road is smooth.
Automedons are our strikers,
Our threes are indefatigable,
And miles, to amuse the idle gaze,
They flash in my eyes like a fence.
Unfortunately, Larina was dragging,
Afraid of expensive runs,
Not on the post office, on their own,
And our virgin enjoyed it
The boredom of the road is quite:
They drove for seven days.
But it's really close. In front of them
The white stone of Moscow
Like the heat, with golden crosses
Old chapters are burning.
Ah, brothers! How pleased I was,
When churches and bell towers,
Gardens, palaces are a semicircle
Suddenly he opened up to me!
How often in a sad separation,
In my wandering destiny,
Moscow, I was thinking about you!
Moscow how much is in this sound
For the heart of the Russian it has merged!
How much it resonated!
Here, surrounded by his oak grove,
Petrovsky Castle. He's gloomy.
Recently, he is proud of his fame.
Napoleon waited in vain,
Intoxicated with the last happiness,
Moscow kneeling
With the keys of the old Kremlin:
No, my Moscow didn't go
To him with a guilty head.
Not a holiday, not an adopted gift,
She was preparing a fire
An impatient hero.
I'm out of here, immersed in the duma,
He looked at the menacing flame.
Farewell, witness of fallen glory,
Petrovsky Castle. Well! Don't stand there,
Go away! The pillars of the outpost are already there
They turn white: that's really on Tverskaya
The cart rushes through potholes.
Women flash past the booth,
Boys, shops, lanterns,
Palaces, gardens, monasteries,
Bukharans, sleighs, vegetable gardens,
Merchants, hovels, men,
Boulevards, towers, Cossacks,
Pharmacies, fashion stores,
Balconies, lions on the gates
And flocks of jackdaws on crosses.
In this tedious walk
An hour or two passes, and now
At Kharitonya's in the alley
A cart in front of the house at the gate
He stopped. To an old aunt,
The fourth year of the patient in consumption,
They have arrived now.
The door opens wide for them,
In glasses, in a tattered caftan,
With a stocking in his hand, a gray-haired Kalmyk.
Scream meets them in the living room
The Princess stretched out on the sofa.
The old ladies hugged each other crying,
And the exclamations poured out.
Who would have thought? How long ago!
For how long? Honey! Cousin!
Sit down as it is difficult!
By God, a scene from a novel
It's like I'm dreaming
Cousin, do you remember Grandison?
How, Grandison?.. Ah, Grandison!
Yes, I remember, I remember. Where is he?
He visited me on Christmas Eve;
He recently married his son.
And that one, but we'll tell you everything after,
Isn't it true? All her family
We'll show Tanya tomorrow.
It's a pity I don't have the time to drive around.;
I can barely drag my legs.
But you are exhausted from the road;
Let's go to rest together
Oh, there is no power
My joy is heavy now,
Not only sadness, my soul,
I'm no good at anything.
Life is so disgusting in old age
And here, I'm completely tired,
She coughed in tears.
Sick and fondling and fun
Tatiana is being touched; but she
It's not good for a housewarming party,
Accustomed to her room.
Under the silk curtain
She can't sleep in her new bed,
And the early ringing of the bells,
The forerunner of morning labors,
She gets out of bed.
Tanya sits down by the window.
The twilight is thinning; but she
She does not distinguish her fields:
An unfamiliar yard is in front of her,
Stable, kitchen and fence.
And so: for related dinners
Tanya is delivered every day
To present to the grandparents
Her absent-minded laziness.
Relatives who arrived from afar,
There is an affectionate meeting everywhere,
And exclamations, and bread and salt.
How Tanya has grown up! A long time ago
Didn't I baptize you?
And I took it in my arms like that!
And I was so hard on the ears!
And I fed it with gingerbread!
And the grandmothers repeat in chorus:
But there is no change in them;
Everything in them is based on the old pattern:
At the aunt of Princess Elena
The same tulle cap;
Everything is white Lukerya Lvovna,
The same lies Lyubov Petrovna,
Ivan Petrovich is just as stupid,
Semyon Petrovich is also stingy,
At Pelageya Nikolaevna's
The same friend Monsieur Finmouche,
And the same Pomeranian, and the same husband;
And he's still a good member of the club,
Still humble, just as deaf
And he also eats and drinks for two.
Their daughters hug Tanya.
The Younger Graces of Moscow
At first they look around in silence
Tatiana from head to toe;
They find her strange,
Provincial and simpering,
And something pale and thin,
But very good-looking;
Then, obeying nature,
They make friends with her, lead her to themselves,
Kiss her, gently shake her hands,
Fluff her curls according to fashion
And they chant
Secrets are heartfelt, secrets of virgins,
Other people's and their own victories,
Hopes, pranks, dreams.
Innocent conversations are flowing
With the embellishment of light slander.
Then, in return for babbling,
Her heartfelt confession
They tenderly demand one.
But Tanya, just like in a dream,
He hears their speeches without participation,
He doesn't understand anything,
And the secret of his heart,
A treasured treasure of tears and happiness,
Keeps silent meanwhile
And he doesn't share it with anyone.
Tatiana wants to listen
Into conversations, into a general conversation;
But everyone in the living room is occupied
Such incoherent, vulgar nonsense;
Everything about them is so pale, indifferent;
They slander even boring;
In the fruitless dryness of speeches,
Inquiries, gossip and news
Thoughts will not flare up for a whole day,
At least casually, at least at random;
A languid mind will not smile,
My heart will not tremble, even for a joke.
And even funny nonsense
You won't find it in you, the light is empty.
Archived young men in a crowd
They look at Tanya primly
And about her among themselves
They speak unfavorably.
Some kind of sad buffoon
He finds her perfect
And leaning against the door,
He's preparing an elegy for her.
I met Tanya at the boring aunt's,
Vyazemsky somehow got hooked on her
And I managed to occupy her soul.
And, near him, she was noticed,
About her, adjusting your wig,
The old man inquires.
But where Melpomene is stormy
A prolonged howl is heard,
Where he waves a tinsel mantle
She is in front of a cold crowd,
Where Thalia is quietly napping
And he does not listen to friendly splashes,
Where Terpsichore is the only one
The young viewer is amazed
(Which was also the case in previous years,
During your time and mine),
Did not apply to her
I will not give you jealous lorgnettes,
No tube of fashion connoisseurs
From the boxes and the chair rows.
It is also brought to the Assembly.
There's crowding, excitement, heat,
There is a roar of music, a sparkle of candles,
A flicker, a whirlwind of fast vapors,
Beauties light headdresses,
The choirs are full of people,
The bride is a vast semicircle,
All the senses are suddenly struck.
There seem to be smart people here
Your insolence, your vest
And an inattentive lorgnette.
Here are the Hussars on leave
They are in a hurry to appear, to thunder,
To shine, captivate and fly away.
The night has many lovely stars,
There are many beauties in Moscow.
But brighter than all the friends of heaven
The moon is in the air blue.
But the one that I dare not
To disturb with my lyre,
Like a majestic moon,
There is one shining among the wives and maidens.
With what heavenly pride
It touches the earth!
How full her breasts are!
How beautiful her wonderful gaze is!..
But come on, come on; stop it:
You have paid tribute to madness.
Noise, laughter, running, bowing,
Galloping, mazurka, waltz Meanwhile,
Between two aunts at the column,
Unnoticed by anyone,
Tatiana looks and does not see,
Hates the excitement of the light;
She's stuffy here, she's a dream
Aspires to a field life,
To the village, to the poor villagers,
To a secluded corner,
Where the bright stream flows,
To your flowers, to your novels
And into the twilight of the lime alleys,
To where he appeared to her.
So her thought wanders far away:
The light and the noisy ball are forgotten,
Meanwhile, he doesn't take his eyes off her
Some important general.
The aunts blinked at each other
And Tanya was elbowed at once,
And each one whispered to her:
In that pile, see? ahead,
Where there are two more in uniform
That's gone
But here we congratulate you on your victory
My dear Tatiana
And we will direct our way to the side,
So as not to forget who I'm singing about
By the way, there are two words about that here:
I'm singing a younger friend
And a lot of his quirks.
Bless my long work,
O you epic muse!
And, handing me the faithful staff,
Don't let me wander off at random.
Quite. Off with the burden!
I saluted classicism:
Although it's late, there is an introduction.
In those days when in the gardens of the Lyceum
I was blossoming serenely,
I read Apuleius willingly,
And I haven't read Cicero,
In those days in the mysterious valleys,
In the spring, with the clicks of the swan,
Near the waters that shone in silence,
The muse began to appear to me.
My student cell
Suddenly it dawned on me: the muse is in her
She opened a feast of young ideas,
Sang of children's fun,
And the glory of our antiquity,
And the hearts are trembling dreams.
And the light greeted her with a smile;
Success inspired us first;
Old Derzhavin noticed us
And when he went down to the coffin, he blessed him.
And I, imputing to myself the law
There is a single arbitrariness of passions,
Sharing feelings with the crowd,
I brought a frisky muse
To the noise of feasts and riotous disputes,
Thunderstorms of the midnight Watches;
And to them in crazy feasts
She carried her gifts
And how the bacchante frolicked,
She sang for the guests over the bowl,
And the youth of bygone days
She was following her wildly,
And I was proud among friends
My windy friend.
But I fell behind their union
And She ran after me into the distance.
How often is the affectionate muse
I was delighting in the path of the mute
The magic of a secret story!
How often on the rocks of the Caucasus
She is Lenore, in the moonlight,
She rode a horse with me!
How often is it on the shores of Taurida
She's got me in the dark of the night
She drove me to listen to the noise of the sea,
The incessant whisper of Nereida,
A deep, eternal chorus of shafts,
A hymn of praise to the father of the worlds.
And, having forgotten the capital of the far
And glitter and noisy feasts,
In the wilderness of Moldova sad
She is humble tents
I visited the wandering tribes,
And she went wild between them,
And I forgot the speech of the gods
For sparse, strange languages,
For the songs of the steppe, dear to her
Suddenly everything changed,
And here she is in my garden
She appeared as a young lady of the district,
With a sad thought in his eyes,
With a French book in his hands.
And now I am a muse for the first time
I'm bringing you to a social event;
On the charms of her steppe
I look at it with jealous shyness.
Through a tight row of aristocrats,
Military dandies, diplomats
And proud ladies she glides;
So she sat down quietly and looked,
Admiring the noisy crowding,
The flashing of dresses and speeches,
The slow appearance of guests
In front of the young mistress
And the dark frame of men
Around the ladies as near the paintings.
She likes the order slim
Oligarchic conversations,
And the cold of calm pride,
And this mixture of ranks and years.
But who is this in the chosen crowd
Is it silent and foggy?
He seems like a stranger to everyone.
Faces flash in front of him
Like a series of annoying ghosts.
What, spleen or suffering arrogance
In his face? Why is he here?
Who is he? Is it really Eugene?
Is it really him?.. That's right, he is.
How long has it been brought to us?
Is he still the same or has he been pacified?
Or is he also acting like a weirdo?
Tell me: how did he return?
What will he present to us so far?
What will it be now? Melmotte,
A cosmopolitan, a patriot,
Harold, a Quaker, a prude,
Or someone else flaunts a mask,
Or just be a good guy,
How are you and I, like the whole world?
At least my advice
Is to get behind the run-down fashion.
He had fooled the light enough
Yes and no.
Why is it so unfavorable
Do you speak about him?
For the fact that we are restless
We are busy, we judge everything,
That ardent souls are careless
Selfish insignificance
Or offends, or makes you laugh,
That the mind, loving space, is cramping,
That there are too many conversations
We are happy to accept for business,
That stupidity is windy and evil,
That nonsense is important to important people
And that mediocrity is the only one
Are we up to the task and not strange?
Blessed is he who was young when he was young,
Blessed is he who matured in time,
Who is gradually getting cold in life
He was able to endure with the years;
Who has not indulged in strange dreams,
Who was no stranger to the secular rabble,
Who was a dandy or a grabber at the age of twenty,
And at thirty he is advantageously married;
Who was released at fifty
From private and other debts,
Who has fame, money and ranks
Calmly I got in line,
Who has been talked about for a century:
N. N. is a wonderful person.
But it's sad to think that it's in vain
We were given youth,
That they cheated on her every hour,
That she deceived us;
What are our best wishes,
What are our fresh dreams
Decayed in a quick succession,
Like leaves rotten in autumn.
It's unbearable to see in front of you
There is a long row of dinners alone,
To look at life as a rite of passage,
And following the orderly crowd
To go without sharing with her
No common opinions, no passions.
The subject of noisy judgments,
Unbearable (agree on that)
Between reasonable people
To be known as a fake weirdo,
Or a sad madcap,
Or a satanic freak,
Or even my demon.
Onegin (I'll take care of him again),
By killing a friend in a duel,
Having lived without a goal, without labors
Until the age of twenty-six,
Languishing in idle leisure
No service, no wife, no business,
He couldn't do anything.
He became restless,
Hunting for a change of places
(A very painful property)
(A voluntary cross).
He left his village,
Forests and fields of solitude,
Where is the bloody shadow
She appeared to him every day,
And he began to wander without a purpose,
Accessible to feeling alone;
And travel to him,
Like everything in the world, tired of;
He came back and got,
Like Chatsky, from the ship to the ball.
But now the crowd hesitated,
A whisper ran through the hall
The lady was approaching the hostess,
An important general is behind her.
She was unhurried,
Not cold, not talkative,
Without a brazen look for everyone,
Without pretensions to success,
Without these little antics,
Without imitative ideas
Everything was quiet, it was just in her,
She seemed like the right shot
Du comme faut (Shishkov, I'm sorry:
I don't know how to translate it.)
The ladies moved closer to her;
The old ladies smiled at her;
The men bowed lower,
Caught the gaze of her eyes;
The girls were quieter
In front of her in the hall, and all above
He raised his nose and shoulders
The general who entered with her.
No one could have made her beautiful
To name; but from head to toe
No one could have found it in her
The fact that fashion is autocratic
In the high London circle
It's called idag. (I can't
I really love this word,
But I can't translate it;
It is still new to us,
And it is unlikely to be in his honor.
It would be suitable in an epigram)
But I'm talking to our lady.
She is sweet with careless charm,
She was sitting at the table
With the brilliant Nina Voronskaya,
This Cleopatra of the Neva;
And that's right, you would agree,
That Nina is a marble beauty
She couldn't outshine her neighbor,
At least she was dazzling.
Is she really? But for sure
How! From the wilderness of steppe villages
And an obtrusive lorgnette
He's paying attention every minute
The one whose appearance vaguely reminded
He has forgotten features.
Tell me, Prince, don't you know,
Who's there in the crimson beret
Does he speak to the Spanish ambassador?
The Prince looks at Onegin.
Yeah! It's been a long time since you've been in the world.
Wait, I'll introduce you.
So you're married! I didn't know about the wound!
How long has it been?
The Prince is coming
To his wife and brings her
My family and my friend.
The Princess looks at him
And whatever confused her soul,
No matter how strong she was
Surprised, amazed,
But nothing changed her:
It retains the same tone,
Her bow was just as quiet.
By God! Not that she shuddered.
Or she suddenly became pale, red
She didn't even move an eyebrow.;
She didn't even press her lips together.
Although he looked at it, he couldn't be more diligent,
But there are also traces of Tatiana the former
Onegin could not find it.
He wanted to start a conversation with her
And he couldn't. She asked if he had been here long, where he came from
And isn't it one of their sides?
Then she turned to her husband
Tired look; slipped out
And he remained motionless.
Is that really the same Tatiana,
Which he is alone with,
At the beginning of our novel,
In the remote, distant side,
In the good heat of moralizing,
I once read the instructions,
The one from which he keeps
The letter where the heart speaks,
Where everything is safe, everything is free,
That girl, or is it a dream?..
That girl he's
Neglected in a humble way,
Have you been with him just now
So indifferent, so brave?
He leaves the party cramped,
He goes home thoughtfully;
A dream that is sad, then charming
He is disturbed by his late sleep.
He woke up; they brought him
Letter: Prince N humbly requests
It's for the evening. God! to her!..
Oh, I will, I will! And soon
He defiles the courteous answer.
What's wrong with him? What a strange dream he's in!
What stirred in the depths
Cold and lazy souls?
Annoyance? vanity? or again
The care of youth is love?
Onegin is counting the clock again,
He won't wait for the day to end again.
But ten o'clock strikes; he leaves,
He flew, he's at the porch,
He enters the Princess with trepidation;
He finds Tatiana alone,
And together for a few minutes
They're sitting. The words won't come
From the mouth of Onegin. Sullen,
Awkward, he's barely
He answers her. Head
His is full of stubborn thought.
He stares stubbornly: she
She sits quietly and is free.
The husband comes. He interrupts
This unpleasant tete-a-tete;
With Onegin, he recalls
Pranks, jokes of former years.
They're laughing. The guests enter.
Here is a large salt of secular anger
The conversation began to revive;
A little nonsense in front of the hostess
Sparkled without silly affectation,
And interrupted him in the meantime
A reasonable sense without vulgar topics,
Without eternal truths, without pedantry,
And he didn't scare anyone's ears.
By his free vivacity.
There was, however, the color of the capital,
And know and fashion patterns,
There are foxes everywhere,
Necessary fools;
There were elderly ladies here
In caps and roses, they look evil;
There were several girls here,
Not smiling faces;
There was a messenger who spoke
About public affairs;
He was wearing fragrant gray hair here
The old man, joking in the old way:
Superbly subtle and clever,
Which is kind of funny these days.
He was a sucker for epigrams here,
An angry gentleman for everything:
The master's tea is too sweet,
On the plane of the ladies, on the tone of the men,
On the rumors about the misty novel,
On the monogram, given to two sisters,
On the lies of magazines, on the war,
At the snow and at his wife.
There was Prolasov, who deserved
Fame for the baseness of the soul,
In all albums, blunted,
St.-Rest, your pencils;
There is another dictator in the doorway.
He stood like a magazine picture,
Blushing like a palm cherub,
Tightened, mute and motionless,
And the traveler is a stray,
Starched brute,
He excited a smile at a party
With his caring posture,
And silently exchanged glances
He was given a general sentence.
But my Onegin evening is whole
I was busy with Tatiana alone,
Not this timid girl,
In love, poor and simple,
But an indifferent princess,
But an unapproachable goddess
The magnificent, regal Neva.
O people! You all look alike
To the ancestress Eva:
What is given to you does not attract
You, the serpent constantly calls you
To myself, to the mysterious tree;
Give you the forbidden fruit:
And without that, heaven is not heaven for you.
How Tatiana has changed!
How firmly she has entered into her role!
As an oppressive dignity
I've accepted the receptions soon!
Who would dare to look for a gentle girl
In this majestic, in this careless
The legislator's room?
And he worried her heart!
She's talking about him in the dark of the night,
Until Morpheus arrives,
Used to be virginally sad,
Languid eyes are raised to the moon,
Dreaming with him someday
To complete the humble way of life!
All ages are submissive to love;
But to young, virgin hearts
Her impulses are beneficial,
Like storms in the fields:
In the rain of passions, they are fresh,
They are both being updated and maturing
And a powerful life gives
Both the lush color and the sweet fruit.
But at a late age and infertile,
At the turn of our years,
Sad is the dead trail of passion:
So the storms of autumn are cold
A meadow is turned into a swamp
And they expose the forest around.
There is no doubt: alas! Evgeniy
I'm in love with Tatiana like a child;
In the anguish of love thoughts
He spends both day and night.
Mind not heeding strict penalties,
To her porch, the glass vestibule
He drives up every day;
He's chasing her like a shadow.;
He's happy if he throws it at her
Fluffy boa on the shoulder,
Or it will touch you hotly
Her hands, or spread them apart
Before her is a motley regiment of liveries,
Or the handkerchief will lift it up.
She doesn't notice him.,
No matter how hard he fights, even if he dies.
Freely accepts at home,
When visiting with him, he says three words,
Sometimes he will meet you with a bow,
Sometimes he won't notice at all:
There is not a drop of coquetry in her
He is not tolerated by the upper class.
Onegin begins to turn pale:
She can't see it, or she's not sorry;
Onegin dries up and barely
He's not suffering from consumption.
Everyone sends Onegin to the doctors,
They send him to the waters in unison.
But he's not going; he's ahead of time
I am ready to write to my great-grandfathers
About an early meeting; and Tatiana
And there is no case (their gender is like that);
And he is stubborn, he does not want to fall behind,
He still hopes, he is busy;
Be brave, healthy, sick,
To the Princess with a weak hand
He's writing a passionate message.
At least it's not much use at all
He didn't see anything in the letters.;
But, to know, heartache
It has already come to him unbearably.
Here is his letter exactly to you.
Onegin's letter to Tatiana
I foresee everything: you will be offended
There is an explanation for the sad mystery.
What a bitter contempt
Your proud look will portray!
What do I want? for what purpose
Will I open my soul to you?
What kind of malicious fun,
Maybe I'm giving you an excuse!
I met you by chance sometime,
I notice a spark of tenderness in you,
I didn't dare to believe her:
I didn 't give the sweet habit a go;
His abominable freedom
I didn't want to lose it.
One more thing separated us
Lensky fell an unfortunate victim
From everything that is sweet to the heart,
Then I tore off my heart;
A stranger to everyone, not bound by anything,
I thought: freedom and peace
A substitute for happiness. Oh my God!
How I made a mistake, how I was punished.
No, I see you every minute,
Follow you everywhere,
The smile of the mouth, the movement of the eyes
To catch with loving eyes,
To listen to you for a long time, to understand
Your soul is all your perfection,
To freeze in agony before you,
To pale and fade away is bliss!
And I am deprived of that: for you
I go everywhere at random;
The day is dear to me, the hour is dear to me:
And I'm wasting my time in vain
The days counted by fate.
And they are so painful.
I know: my age has already been measured;
But to prolong my life,
I have to be sure in the morning,
That I'll see you in the afternoon
I'm afraid: in my humble prayer
He will see your stern gaze
The schemes of a despicable cunning
And I hear your angry reproach.
When would you know how terrible it is
Longing for love,
To burn with reason every hour
To subdue the excitement in the blood;
To want to hug your knees
And, sobbing, at your feet
Pour out pleas, confessions, penalties,
Everything, everything that I could express,
Meanwhile, with a feigned cold
Arming both speech and gaze,
Have a calm conversation,
To look at you with a cheerful look!..
But so be it: I'm on my own
I can't resist anymore;
It's all settled: I'm at your will
And I surrender to my fate.
There is no answer. He's a messenger again:
The second, the third letter
There is no answer. In one assembly
He's on his way; just let him in
She's coming towards me. How harsh!
They don't see him, not a word with him;
U! How is it surrounded now
She is the Epiphany cold!
How to keep resentment
Stubborn mouths want to!
Onegin fixed his sharp gaze:
Where, where is the confusion, compassion?
Where are the tear stains?.. They are not there, they are not there!
There is only a trace of anger on this face
Yes, maybe the fear of secrecy,
So that the husband or the light did not guess
Leprosy, occasional weakness
Everything that my Onegin knew
There is no hope! He's leaving,
He curses his madness
And, it is deeply immersed in,
He renounced the light again.
And in the silent office
He remembered it was time,
When there is a severe melancholy
He was being chased in a noisy light,
I caught it, took it by the collar
And locked it in a dark corner.
He began to read again indiscriminately.
He read Gibbon, Rousseau,
Manzoni, Herder, Chamfort,
Madame de Stae, Bichat, Tissot,
I read the skeptical White,
I read the works of Fontenelle,
I read some of our books,
Not rejecting anything:
Both almanacs and magazines,
Where are the teachings they tell us,
Where do they scold me like that nowadays,
And where are the madrigals
I have sometimes met myself:
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
And what about it? His eyes read,
But my thoughts were far away;
Dreams, desires, sorrows
They pressed deep into the soul.
It is between the printed lines
I read with spiritual eyes
Other lines. He's in them.
It was completely deepened.
Those were secret legends
Warm, dark old days,
Unrelated dreams,
Threats, rumors, predictions,
Or a long tale of living nonsense,
Or letters from a young virgin.
And gradually put to sleep
He falls into both feelings and thoughts,
And in front of him is imagination
The pharaoh is throwing his motley sword.
That's what he sees: on the melted snow,
It's like sleeping at night,
The young man lies motionless,
And hears a voice: well? dead.
Then he sees the forgotten enemies,
Slanderers, and evil cowards,
And a swarm of young traitors,
And the circle of despicable comrades,
That's a country house and by the window
She's sitting there and that's it!..
He's so used to getting lost in this,
That I almost went crazy
Or he didn't become a poet.
To admit it: I would have borrowed it!
And for sure: by the power of magnetism
Poems of the Russian mechanism
Almost at that time I did not comprehend
My stupid student.
How he looked like a poet,
When there was one sitting in the corner,
And there was a fireplace burning in front of him,
And he was purring: You're right.
Or do mo and dropped
Into the fire, then a shoe, then a magazine.
The days raced by; the air was heated
Winter has already been resolved;
And he didn't become a poet.,
He didn't die, he didn't go crazy.
Spring brings him to life: for the first time
Their rooms are locked,
Where he wintered like a groundhog,
Double windows, fireplaces
He leaves on a clear morning,
Rushes along the Neva River in a sleigh.
On blue, excised ice
The sun is playing; it's melting dirty
There is snow on the streets.
Where does your fast running go on it
Is Onegin striving? You are in advance
You guessed it; that's right:
He rushed to her, to his Tatiana
My uncorrected weirdo.
He looks like a dead man.
There is not a single soul in the hallway.
He's in the hall; next: no one.
He opened the door. Well, his
Is it striking with such force?
The Princess is in front of him, alone,
Sitting, not cleaned, pale,
He's reading some kind of letter
And quietly tears are pouring down like a river,
Leaning on his hand with his cheek.
Oh, who would mute her suffering
I didn't read it in that quick moment!
Who is the old Tanya, poor Tanya
Now I wouldn't recognize the princess!
In the anguish of insane regrets
Eugene fell at her feet;
She shuddered and was silent;
And he looks at Onegin
Without surprise, without anger
His sick, faded gaze,
A pleading look, a mute reproach,
Everything is clear to her. A simple maiden,
With dreams, the heart of the old days,
Now she's resurrected in her again.
She doesn't pick it up
And without taking my eyes off him,
It does not take away from greedy lips
His unfeeling hand
What is her dream now?
A long silence passes,
And finally she quietly says:
Get up. I must
You need to explain yourself frankly.
Onegin, do you remember that hour,
When in the garden, in the alley of us
Fate brought me together, and so humbly
Did I hear your lesson?
It's my turn today.
Onegin, I was younger then,
I think I was better.,
And I loved you; so what?
What have I found in your heart?
What is the answer? one severity.
Isn't it true? It wasn't news to you
A humble girl's love?
And now the blood is getting cold,
As soon as I remember the look is cold
And this sermon But you
I don't blame: in that terrible hour
You did a noble thing.,
You were right in front of me:
I am grateful with all my soul
Then in the desert,
Away from the fuss of rumor,
You didn't like me Well now
Are you following me?
Why do you have me in mind?
Is it not because in high society
Now I have to come;
That I am rich and noble,
That the husband was mutilated in battles,
What are we being caressed by the yard for?
Is it not because my shame
Now I would be noticed by everyone,
And he could have been in the company of a prince
Would you like a tempting honor?
I'm crying if your Tanya
You haven't forgotten until now,
Then know: the barb of your abuse,
A cold, stern conversation,
If only I had the power,
I would prefer an offensive passion.
And these letters and tears.
To my infant dreams
Then at least you had pity,
At least respect for the years
And now! What's at my feet
What brings you here? What a little thing!
How is it with your heart and mind
Being a petty slave's feelings?
And to me, Onegin, this splendor,
A miserable life of tinsel,
My progress in the vortex of light,
My fashion house and evenings,
What's in them? I'm glad to give it back now
All this rags of the masquerade,
All this glitter, and noise, and smoke
For a shelf of books, for a wild garden,
For our poor home,
For those places where the first time,
Onegin, I saw you,
Yes, for the humble cemetery,
Where are the cross and the shadow of the branches today
Over my poor nurse
And happiness was so possible,
So close!.. But my fate
It's already been solved. Careless,
Maybe I did it:
Me with tears of spells
My mother begged; for poor Tanya
All the lots were equal
I got married. You must,
I'm asking you to leave me;
I know: in your heart there is
And pride and direct honor.
I love you (why lie?),
But I'm given to someone else.;
I will be faithful to him forever.
She's gone. It's worth it Eugene,
As if thunderstruck.
What a storm of sensations
Now he is immersed in his heart!
But the spurs did not ring,
And Tatiana's husband showed up,
And here is my hero,
In a moment that was evil for him,
Reader, we will leave now,
For a long time forever. It's
Enough for us to follow one path
We wandered around the world. Congratulations
Each other with the shore. Hurray!
It would have been a long time ago (wouldn't it?) It's time!
Whoever you are, oh my reader,
Friend, foe, I want to be with you
To break up now as a friend.
Sorry. Why would you follow me
Here I did not look for careless stanzas,
Are there any rebellious memories,
Rest from labors,
Tableaux vivants, or sharp words,
Or grammatical errors,
God grant that in this book you
For entertainment, for dreams,
For the heart, for magazine bumps
Although I could find a grain.
We'll break up for this, I'm sorry!
Forgive me, my strange companion,
And you, my faithful ideal,
And you, a living and constant,
Albeit a small work. I knew with you
All that is enviable for a poet:
The oblivion of life in the storms of light,
A sweet conversation of friends.
Many, many days have passed
Since the young Tatiana
And Onegin is with her in a vague dream
Appeared to me for the first time
And the distance of a free novel
I'm through a magic crystal
I haven't clearly distinguished it yet.
But those who are in a friendly meeting
I read the first stanzas
There are no others, but those are far away,
As Sadi once said.
Without them, Onegin is finished.
And the one with whom he is educated
Tatiana's sweet ideal
Oh, a lot, a lot of rock has gone away!
Blessed is he who celebrates life early
I left it without finishing it to the bottom
A glass full of wine,
Who hasn't read her novel
And suddenly he knew how to part with it,
As I am with my Onegin.
